  message: 'The aggregation query lacks proper nesting-level tracking, which can lead
    to incorrect query processing in nested MBQL queries. This vulnerability was fixed
    by introducing a dynamic nesting-level variable to track the depth of nesting.
    To fix this, ensure that the `aggregation-at-index` function is called with the
    `*nesting-level*` parameter.
