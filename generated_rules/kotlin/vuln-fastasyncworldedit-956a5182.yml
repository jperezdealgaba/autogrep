  message: 'The version string is being constructed using a build number, which can
    introduce inconsistency and potential security issues. This practice can lead
    to versioning conflicts and make it harder to track and manage releases. It is
    recommended to use a stable version format without dynamic build numbers to ensure
    consistency and security.
