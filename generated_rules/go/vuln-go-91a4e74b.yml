  message: 'The code fails to properly validate handshake message length, which could
    allow

    for buffer overflows or excessive memory allocation. The vulnerability occurs

    when checking if the handshake message fits within the buffer without first

    verifying that the message length is within acceptable bounds. This could be

    exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially execute

    arbitrary code. The fix adds proper bounds checking by first verifying the

    message length against a maximum allowed value before checking if it fits in

    the buffer.
