  message: 'Using a global certificate cache without proper instance isolation can
    lead to

    certificate management issues during in-process reloads. The global state may

    persist across reloads, causing memory leaks and potential certificate conflicts.

    The fix introduces an instance-specific certificate cache that gets garbage

    collected after reloads, preventing these issues.
