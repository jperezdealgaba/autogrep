  message: 'Detected a potential Host header validation vulnerability. Previously,
    invalid Host headers would return an error, which could lead to header or request
    smuggling. The fix ensures that invalid Host headers are zeroed out when not using
    a proxy, preventing potential smuggling vectors. Update the code to handle invalid
    Host headers by setting them to an empty string when not using a proxy.
