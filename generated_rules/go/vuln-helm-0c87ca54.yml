  message: 'The description for the --atomic flag in Helm''s installation command
    uses the term "purges chart on fail," which is ambiguous and could lead to misunderstandings.
    This could result in incorrect assumptions about the behavior of the --atomic
    flag, potentially leading to security risks or unintended data loss. The description
    should be updated to use clear and precise language, such as "deletes the installation
    on failure," to accurately convey the flag''s functionality.
