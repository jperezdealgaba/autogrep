  message: 'The original code contains a vulnerability in the Montgomery multiplication
    implementation where it fails to properly handle carry propagation. This can lead
    to incorrect results in cryptographic operations, potentially causing security
    vulnerabilities. The fix introduces additional carry checks to ensure correctness.
    To fix this, ensure that all carry bits are properly accounted for and checked.
