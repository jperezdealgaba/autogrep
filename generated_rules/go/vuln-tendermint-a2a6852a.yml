  message: 'The use of `AddEvidenceFromConsensus` to add evidence directly to the
    evidence pool without proper validation can lead to security vulnerabilities.
    This method bypasses verification and can allow invalid or malicious evidence
    to be added. Instead, use `ReportConflictingVotes` to report conflicting votes,
    which will be properly processed into evidence with the correct timestamp and
    validator set.
