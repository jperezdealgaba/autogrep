  message: 'The code is missing the `WithRelabeledContainerMounts` function call,
    which is necessary to relabel default container mounts for files in `/etc`. This
    can lead to security vulnerabilities where sensitive files like `/etc/hosts`,
    `/etc/hostname`, and `/etc/resolv.conf` are not properly relabeled, potentially
    allowing unauthorized access or modification. To fix this, ensure that `WithRelabeledContainerMounts`
    is called along with `WithMounts` in the `specOpts` append statement.
