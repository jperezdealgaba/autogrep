  message: "The code directly retrieves a repository by owner name and repository\
    \ name without verifying the owner's active status. This can lead to unauthorized\
    \ access to repositories owned by inactive accounts. \nThe vulnerability is dangerous\
    \ because it bypasses account activation checks, potentially allowing access to\
    \ restricted resources.\nTo fix this, ensure the owner's active status is checked\
    \ before retrieving the repository, and use the owner's ID instead of the owner's\
    \ name for repository lookup.\n"
