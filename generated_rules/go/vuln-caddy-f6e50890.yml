  message: 'When no certificate matches and SNI is NOT provided, a random certificate
    is returned. This behavior can lead to serving the wrong certificate, which can
    be dangerous as it may expose sensitive information to unintended recipients.
    Instead, ensure that no certificate is returned when there is no match, which
    will trigger a TLS alert.
