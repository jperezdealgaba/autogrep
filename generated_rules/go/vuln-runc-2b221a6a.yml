  message: 'The error return value from `setRecAttr` is being ignored, which can lead
    to silent failures in setting recursive attributes on the root filesystem. This
    can result in incorrect container configurations and potential security vulnerabilities.
    To fix this, ensure that the return value of `setRecAttr` is properly handled
    and returned.
