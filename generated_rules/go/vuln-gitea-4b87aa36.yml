  message: 'The function `MailParticipants` is called without specifying the action
    type, which can lead to incorrect notification content. This vulnerability occurs
    because the content of the notification is not properly set based on the action
    being performed (e.g., closing or reopening an issue or pull request). Always
    pass the appropriate action type to ensure the correct notification content is
    generated.
