  message: "The constant `maxLineCol` is defined as `1<<30 - 1`, which can lead to\
    \ integer overflow issues. \nThis vulnerability can cause incorrect handling of\
    \ line and column numbers in the scanner, \npotentially leading to security issues\
    \ or unexpected behavior in the code. \nThe fix changes the constant to `1 <<\
    \ 30` to prevent overflow.\n"
