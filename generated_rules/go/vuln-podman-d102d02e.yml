  message: 'Detected a potential security vulnerability where the CNI lock file is
    created in a temporary directory. This could lead to race conditions or security
    issues if the temporary directory is not properly secured. The issue has been
    fixed by creating the lock file in a dedicated CNI configuration directory. To
    fix this, ensure that the lock file is created in a secure, dedicated directory.
