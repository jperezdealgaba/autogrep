  message: 'Detected unsafe ZIP comment boundary check that could lead to truncated
    comment processing.

    This vulnerability could allow malicious ZIP files to bypass validation checks
    by hiding

    additional data in truncated comments. The fix is to return -1 when the comment
    is truncated

    rather than proceeding with potentially invalid data.
