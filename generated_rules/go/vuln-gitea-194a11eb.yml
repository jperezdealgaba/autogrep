  message: 'Detected a potential security vulnerability where email addresses are
    passed directly to SendIssueCommentMail and SendIssueMentionMail functions without
    being properly iterated over. This could lead to unintended email delivery or
    information leakage. The fix involves iterating over each recipient and sending
    the email individually to ensure proper handling of recipients.
