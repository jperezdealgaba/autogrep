  message: 'The function `dumpEnvoy` is vulnerable because it does not apply post-processing
    to sensitive data before writing it to a file. This can lead to exposure of sensitive
    information such as API keys, certificates, and private keys. The fix involves
    using `downloadToFileWithPostProcess` to apply a post-processing function that
    masks sensitive data. Always ensure sensitive data is properly masked or redacted
    before writing it to a file.
