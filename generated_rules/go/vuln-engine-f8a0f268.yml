  message: 'Detected usage of `maskSecretKeys` with a path parameter, which was removed
    in the fix. This could lead to improper masking of sensitive data in certain API
    paths. The path parameter is no longer needed and should be removed to ensure
    consistent masking of sensitive data across all API endpoints.
