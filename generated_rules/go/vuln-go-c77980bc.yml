  message: 'Detected unsafe type assertion when using RSA encryption. Directly casting
    the certificate''s public key without type checking can lead to runtime panics
    if the key type is incorrect. Always validate the key type using a type assertion
    with a boolean check before proceeding with encryption operations.

    This vulnerability can cause the application to crash when dealing with certificates
    that don''t contain RSA public keys, potentially leading to denial of service.

    To fix this, use a type assertion with a boolean check and handle the error case
    appropriately.
