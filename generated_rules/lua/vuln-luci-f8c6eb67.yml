  message: 'The function `require_post_security` is being called without passing the
    `args` parameter, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. This issue was fixed
    by adding the `args` parameter to ensure proper security checks are performed.
    Always pass the `args` parameter to `require_post_security` to maintain security.
