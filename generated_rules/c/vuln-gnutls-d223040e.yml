  message: 'The vulnerability involves an incorrect bounds check in the decryption
    logic, where the ciphertext size is compared with the sum of the block size and
    hash size. This can lead to potential security issues such as buffer underflows
    or incorrect error handling in cryptographic operations. The fix changes the comparison
    to ensure proper bounds checking. To fix this, ensure that the bounds check correctly
    verifies the ciphertext size against the expected minimum size.
