  message: 'The function `sqlite3ExprIsVtabRef` is used to check if an expression
    references a virtual table, but it does not handle cases where `y.pTab` is null,
    which can lead to undefined behavior. This vulnerability was fixed by replacing
    `sqlite3ExprIsVtabRef` with `ExprIsVtab` and adding null checks. To fix this,
    ensure that all virtual table reference checks include proper null handling.
