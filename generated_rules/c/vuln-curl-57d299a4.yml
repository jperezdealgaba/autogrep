  message: 'This code is vulnerable to integer overflow during memory allocation,
    which can lead to buffer overflow attacks. The multiplication of `len` by 2 in
    `malloc(len * 2)` can result in a value that exceeds the maximum size of a size_t,
    leading to a smaller buffer being allocated than expected. This can then be exploited
    to overwrite adjacent memory. To fix this, add a check to ensure that `len` is
    not larger than `SIZE_T_MAX/2` before performing the multiplication.
