  message: 'Detected use of `wmem_alloc` without zero-initialization, which can lead
    to information disclosure vulnerabilities. The function `wmem_alloc` allocates
    memory but does not initialize it, potentially exposing sensitive data. Use `wmem_alloc0`
    instead, which zero-initializes the allocated memory, ensuring no residual data
    is exposed.
