  message: 'The code incorrectly allows a block size of 256, which is below BDRV_SECTOR_SIZE
    and can lead to handling errors in SCSI commands. This can cause security vulnerabilities
    or system crashes. The fix is to disallow block sizes of 256 by changing the bitmask
    from ~0xff00 to ~0xfe00.
