  message: 'Detected a potentially unsafe memory allocation using `data->set.buffer_size`
    which could lead to buffer overflow or insufficient memory allocation. This vulnerability
    arises because the buffer size is dynamically determined from a user-controlled
    structure, which may not be properly validated. To fix this, use a defined constant
    like `UPLOAD_BUFSIZE` instead of dynamically calculated sizes, and ensure proper
    bounds checking with `DEBUGASSERT`.
