  message: 'The function `checkstackGC` is called without considering the delta value,
    which can lead to stack overflow vulnerabilities. This vulnerability occurs because
    the stack size calculation does not account for the delta, potentially causing
    insufficient stack space to be allocated. The fix involves using `checkstackGCp`
    with the correct delta calculation to ensure proper stack space management. Always
    ensure that stack size calculations account for any necessary adjustments to prevent
    overflow.
