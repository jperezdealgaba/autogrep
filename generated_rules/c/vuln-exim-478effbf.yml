  message: 'This rule detects a vulnerability where the growth calculation for a string
    buffer is incorrectly computed by subtracting the difference between two pointers.
    This can lead to incorrect buffer sizing, potentially causing buffer overflows
    or underflows. The fix is to directly use the desired width without the unnecessary
    pointer arithmetic.
