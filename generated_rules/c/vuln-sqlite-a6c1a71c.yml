  message: 'The condition in the if-statement does not check for parse errors (nErr),
    which could lead to incorrect execution flow when errors occur. This is dangerous
    because it may cause the program to proceed with invalid or unexpected data. To
    fix this, ensure that parse errors are checked before other conditions in the
    if-statement.
