  message: 'The code incorrectly handles ANSI escape sequences by not properly checking
    the character after an escape sequence. This can lead to incorrect parsing of
    ANSI codes, potentially causing security issues such as command injection or unexpected
    behavior. The fix ensures that the character is properly validated before returning
    the ANSI end state.
