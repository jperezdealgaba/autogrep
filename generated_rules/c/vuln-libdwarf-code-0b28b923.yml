  message: "Using `Dwarf_Sword` for the shift variable can lead to potential integer\
    \ overflow issues. \nThis is dangerous because it can cause undefined behavior\
    \ or security vulnerabilities in the code. \nThe fix is to use `unsigned` instead\
    \ of `Dwarf_Sword` to ensure proper handling of the shift operation.\n"
