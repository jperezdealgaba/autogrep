  message: 'The variable `old_desc_blocks` is declared as `int` and compared against
    `fs->super->s_first_meta_bg`, which can lead to integer overflow or incorrect
    comparisons due to type mismatch. This vulnerability can cause incorrect behavior
    in filesystem operations. Use `blk64_t` for `old_desc_blocks` and compare it against
    `fs->desc_blocks` to ensure proper type handling and comparison logic.
