  message: 'The use of `fgets()` in this context can lead to incomplete or improperly
    terminated lines, which may cause security vulnerabilities. `fgets()` does not
    guarantee that the returned line fits within the specified buffer size or ends
    with a newline. This can lead to buffer overflows or incorrect parsing of input
    data. Replace `fgets()` with `Curl_get_line()` to ensure that only complete, properly
    terminated lines are processed.
