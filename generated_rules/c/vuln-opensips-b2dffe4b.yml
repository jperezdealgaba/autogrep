  message: 'The code sets the host part of a URI to an empty string and length to
    0, which can lead to issues in code that expects a valid host part. This was fixed
    by keeping the service name as the host part instead of setting it to an empty
    string. To fix this, ensure the host part is properly initialized with a valid
    value.
