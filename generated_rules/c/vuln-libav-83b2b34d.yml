  message: 'The code directly manipulates buffer length and pointer without proper
    bounds checking, which can lead to out-of-bounds access vulnerabilities. This
    pattern was fixed by using the `bytestream2` API for safer buffer handling. Replace
    direct buffer manipulation with `bytestream2` functions to ensure proper bounds
    checking.
