  message: 'Detected unsafe modification of the garbage collector state without proper
    checks.

    This could lead to incorrect garbage collection behavior, potentially causing
    memory leaks or crashes.

    Ensure the garbage collector state is checked and updated safely using the new
    ''gcstp'' mechanism.
