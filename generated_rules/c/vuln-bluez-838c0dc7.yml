  message: 'The code uses `btd_device` directly without proper connection handling,
    which can lead to use-after-free or invalid memory access if the device disconnects.
    The vulnerability was fixed by replacing `btd_device` with `bt_att` and adding
    disconnect handlers. To fix, ensure proper connection state management by using
    `bt_att` and registering disconnect callbacks.
