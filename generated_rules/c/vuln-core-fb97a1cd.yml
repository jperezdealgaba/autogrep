  message: 'The code does not check the total number of MIME parts against the maximum
    allowed limit, which can lead to excessive resource consumption or denial of service.
    This vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted message with
    a large number of nested MIME parts. To fix this, ensure that the total number
    of MIME parts is checked against the maximum limit using `ctx->total_parts_count
    < ctx->max_total_mime_parts`.
