  message: 'The function `labeljumps` is being called with direct access to the `jumps`
    pointer from a statement structure, which can lead to memory management issues.
    This pattern should be updated to pass the statement structure itself rather than
    the `jumps` pointer directly. This ensures proper memory handling and avoids potential
    use-after-free or double-free vulnerabilities.
