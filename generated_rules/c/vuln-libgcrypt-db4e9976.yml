  message: 'Detected a vulnerable implementation of (EC)DSA that does not properly
    modify the random value `k` to mitigate timing attacks. This can lead to side-channel
    attacks where an attacker can recover the private key by observing timing differences
    in the cryptographic operations. The fix involves using `_gcry_dsa_modify_k` to
    ensure `k` is within a safe range, reducing timing variations.
