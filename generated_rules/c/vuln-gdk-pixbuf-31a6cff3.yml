  message: 'Detected an integer overflow vulnerability in image processing code. The
    original code checks for overflow by dividing back, which is unreliable and can
    lead to buffer overflows. The fix should check for potential overflow before multiplication
    by comparing against G_MAXINT divided by the multiplier. This vulnerability could
    lead to memory corruption and potential remote code execution. Fix by using the
    pattern shown in the pattern-not section.
