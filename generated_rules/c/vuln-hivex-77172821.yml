  message: 'The function `_get_children` is called without a depth parameter, which
    can lead to uncontrolled recursion and potential stack overflow. This vulnerability
    was patched in commit 771728218dac2fbf6997a7e53225e75a4c6b7255 by introducing
    a depth limit to prevent excessive recursion. To fix this, ensure that `_get_children`
    is called with a depth parameter and implement a depth check to limit recursion.
