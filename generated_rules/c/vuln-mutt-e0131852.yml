  message: "The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient boundary checking when handling\
    \ string lengths. \nThe original code fails to account for the required space\
    \ for both the pre/post quote characters and the trailing null, which can lead\
    \ to buffer underflow or incorrect string termination. \nThis can result in memory\
    \ corruption or undefined behavior. \nThe fix ensures proper length checking by\
    \ verifying that there is enough space for both quote characters and the null\
    \ terminator.\n"
