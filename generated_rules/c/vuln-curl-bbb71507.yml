  message: 'The function `set_ssl_ciphers` is called without passing the `algIds`
    parameter, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This occurs because
    the function internally uses a static array of size 45 without proper bounds checking.
    To fix this, ensure that `algIds` is passed as a parameter and that bounds checking
    is implemented.
