  message: 'Detected a potential vulnerability due to missing initialization of section_length
    and insufficient size checks for MPEG-TS packets. This can lead to undefined behavior
    or security issues when processing malformed packets. The fix initializes section_length
    to 0 and adds proper size checks for both short and long packets.
