  message: 'This rule detects a vulnerability where memory is freed based on a condition
    that checks flags in a structure. The issue arises because the code might free
    memory incorrectly, leading to potential use-after-free vulnerabilities. The fix
    involves directly freeing the correct memory location without the conditional
    check. To fix this, ensure that memory is freed directly and correctly, avoiding
    conditional checks that might lead to incorrect memory management.
