  message: 'The code contains a complex and error-prone conditional check for character
    ranges that was replaced with a safer function `is_in_cp950_pua`. This vulnerability
    could lead to incorrect character validation, potentially causing security issues
    such as encoding bypass. Replace the manual checks with the dedicated function
    to ensure proper validation.
