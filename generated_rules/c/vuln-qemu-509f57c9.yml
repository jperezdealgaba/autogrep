  message: 'The vulnerability involves incorrect device reference in the `rdma_pci_dma_unmap`
    function call, which could lead to improper DMA unmapping and potential memory
    corruption. The issue was fixed by using the correct device reference from the
    ring structure. Ensure that the correct device reference is passed to `rdma_pci_dma_unmap`
    to avoid such issues.
