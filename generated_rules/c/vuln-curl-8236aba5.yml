  message: 'Potential file handling vulnerability detected. The code attempts to rename
    a file and handles failure by freeing resources but may leave the system in an
    inconsistent state. This could lead to resource leaks or security issues if the
    file operations are not properly handled. Ensure proper error handling and resource
    cleanup in file operations.
