  message: 'The vulnerability is caused by incorrect order of operations in memory
    allocation calculation.

    This can lead to insufficient memory allocation, potentially causing buffer overflows
    or crashes.

    The fix is to ensure the extra space is added before multiplying by the size of
    the block.
