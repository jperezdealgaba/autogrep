  message: 'The use of `FilePathValue` without proper validation can lead to security
    vulnerabilities, particularly when handling Unix socket paths. This function does
    not adequately check for empty or null strings, which can cause undefined behavior
    or security issues. The patch introduces `unixsock_path_value` to properly validate
    and handle Unix socket paths, ensuring that empty or null strings are safely managed.
    To fix this, replace `FilePathValue` with `unixsock_path_value` to ensure proper
    validation.
