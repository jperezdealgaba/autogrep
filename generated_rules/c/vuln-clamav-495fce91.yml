  message: 'This code contains a vulnerability where the length check for a string
    is conditionally determined based on the presence of a string pointer. This can
    lead to inconsistent length calculations, potentially causing buffer overflows
    or other memory-related issues. The vulnerability was fixed by always using the
    object size for the length check. To fix this, ensure consistent length calculations
    are used regardless of the string pointer condition.
