  message: 'Detected a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient
    bounds checking.

    The original condition only checks if the sum of two expressions exceeds a length
    limit,

    but does not verify if either expression individually exceeds the limit. This
    could lead

    to buffer overflows. The fix adds separate checks for each expression before checking

    their sum. Always validate both individual values and their sum against length
    limits.
