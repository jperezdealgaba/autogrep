  message: 'The use of `ssize_t` for return values in this context can lead to potential
    issues with type compatibility and incorrect error handling. The patch replaces
    `ssize_t` with `int` and initializes the variable to 0, which ensures proper type
    usage and initialization. This change prevents potential undefined behavior and
    improves code reliability.
