  message: 'The function `funcnamefromcode` is being used to retrieve a function name,
    which can lead to incorrect or incomplete information about the calling function.
    This can cause issues in error handling and debugging, particularly in cases involving
    finalizers or hooks. The fix replaces `funcnamefromcode` with `funcnamefromcall`,
    which provides a more reliable way to determine the function name based on how
    it was called. Ensure to use `funcnamefromcall` for accurate function name resolution.
