  message: 'This rule detects an insufficient buffer size allocation vulnerability.
    The original code adds 1 to the calculated size, which is insufficient and can
    lead to buffer overflows. The issue was fixed by changing the offset to 2. This
    vulnerability is dangerous because it can result in memory corruption, potentially
    leading to arbitrary code execution or crashes. To fix this, ensure the buffer
    size is calculated with a sufficient offset to accommodate all possible data.
