  message: 'Detected a vulnerability where a pointer dereference is checked for zero
    without considering potential bounds issues. This could lead to out-of-bounds
    access or undefined behavior. The fix introduces a bounds check using a right
    shift operation. Always validate pointer offsets against appropriate bounds to
    prevent security issues.
