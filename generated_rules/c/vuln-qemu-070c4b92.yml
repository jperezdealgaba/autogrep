  message: 'Infinite loop vulnerability detected in network handling code. This can
    lead to denial of service (DoS) as the loop lacks a termination condition. The
    vulnerability was fixed by introducing a counter and a maximum descriptor limit.
    Add a counter and a termination condition to prevent infinite loops.
