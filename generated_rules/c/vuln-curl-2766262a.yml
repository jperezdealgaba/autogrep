  message: 'The code checks for a command response in SMTP protocol but does not account
    for servers that only send the response code without additional text. This can
    lead to incorrect handling of server responses, potentially causing security issues
    or unexpected behavior. The fix includes checking for a response code of length
    5, which is valid according to RFC-4954. Update the condition to handle both cases.
