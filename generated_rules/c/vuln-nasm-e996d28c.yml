  message: 'Detected an issue where conditional checks are not properly chained, which
    could lead to incorrect error handling. The vulnerability occurs when two separate
    if statements are used instead of an if-else chain, potentially causing unintended
    behavior. To fix this, ensure that the second condition is checked only if the
    first condition fails by using an else if statement.
