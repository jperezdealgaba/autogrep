  message: 'The function `bmp_load` is called without checking its return value, which
    can lead to undefined behavior if the function fails. This can cause the program
    to continue executing with invalid data, potentially leading to crashes or security
    vulnerabilities. To fix this, always check the return value of `bmp_load` and
    handle errors appropriately.
