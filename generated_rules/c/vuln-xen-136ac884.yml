  message: 'Detected a potential race condition due to incorrect ordering of memory
    operations.

    The control block is assigned before all queue heads are set, which can lead to
    inconsistent states.

    The fix requires setting all queue heads first, followed by a memory barrier (smp_wmb()),
    and then assigning the control block.
