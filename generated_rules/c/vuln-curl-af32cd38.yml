  message: 'The vulnerability involves the use of the deprecated `http_disable_hostname_check_before_authentication`
    setting, which could allow sensitive authentication headers to be sent to unintended
    hosts. This is dangerous because it could lead to credential leakage to unauthorized
    servers. The issue has been fixed by replacing it with the `allow_auth_to_other_hosts`
    setting, which provides better control over authentication header forwarding.
    Always use the new setting to ensure authentication headers are only sent to trusted
    hosts.
