  message: 'The vulnerability involves incorrect timeout calculation due to improper
    unit conversion. The original code multiplies the timeout by 1000, which can lead
    to incorrect behavior in timeout handling. This could result in premature or delayed
    timeout detection, affecting the reliability of network operations. The fix removes
    the multiplication by 1000, ensuring proper timeout calculation. Always verify
    the units of time-related variables and ensure consistency in calculations.
