  message: 'This rule detects potential buffer overflows in code that directly uses
    an array index

    without bounds checking. The vulnerability occurs when a pointer is calculated
    using

    an index from a buffer without verifying that the resulting pointer is within
    bounds.

    This can lead to memory corruption and potential exploitation. To fix this, always

    validate the index and ensure the resulting pointer is within the bounds of the
    buffer

    before using it.
