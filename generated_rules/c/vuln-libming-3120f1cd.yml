  message: 'The use of ''int'' for storing an offset can lead to integer overflow
    or truncation issues, which may result in memory corruption or incorrect behavior.
    This is particularly dangerous when dealing with large indices or offsets. The
    fix involves using ''unsigned long'' to ensure proper handling of large values.
