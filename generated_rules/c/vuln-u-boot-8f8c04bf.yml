  message: 'Using `int` instead of `uint` for variables that should not hold negative
    values can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
    This is particularly dangerous in low-level operations like I2C communication
    where data integrity is critical. Replace `int` with `uint` for variables that
    should only store non-negative values.
