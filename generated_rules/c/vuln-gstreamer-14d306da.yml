  message: 'The code directly adds 4096 to `avail_out` without checking if it exceeds
    the maximum allowed size, which can lead to integer overflow and memory corruption.
    This vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service or potentially
    execute arbitrary code. To fix this, ensure that the length is checked against
    the maximum allowed size before performing the addition.
