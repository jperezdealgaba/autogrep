  message: 'Directly using ntohs(bh->hdrsize) as a data offset without validation
    can lead to incorrect memory access or buffer overflows if the header size is
    malformed. This vulnerability was fixed by first validating the header size before
    using it as an offset. Always validate network-derived values before using them
    in memory operations.
