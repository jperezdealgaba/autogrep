  message: 'Detected a potential buffer overrun vulnerability due to incorrect boundary
    checks.

    The original code compared the bounds of a sub-buffer with the main buffer, which
    could lead to buffer overruns if not properly validated.

    The fix ensures that the next pointer in the buffer does not exceed the bound
    by more than one, preventing overruns.

    Always validate buffer boundaries carefully to avoid memory corruption vulnerabilities.
