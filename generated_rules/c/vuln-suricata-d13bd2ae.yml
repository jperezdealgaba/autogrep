  message: 'The vulnerability involves incorrect packet length calculation during
    defragmentation, which could lead to buffer overflows or incorrect packet reassembly.
    The issue occurs when the length is incremented by the fragment''s data length
    without considering the fragment''s offset. This can result in incorrect packet
    length calculations, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities. The fix
    is to use MAX(len, frag->offset + frag->data_len) to ensure the packet length
    is updated to the largest known data offset.
