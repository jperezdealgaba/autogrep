  message: 'The code contains a redundant and unsafe pattern where memory is freed
    and an error is returned within nested conditionals. This can lead to double-free
    vulnerabilities or memory leaks if not handled correctly. The fixed version simplifies
    the logic by using a ternary operator, which is safer and more efficient. Replace
    the nested conditionals with a direct return statement using a ternary operator.
