  message: 'The code incorrectly calculates the end pointer by adding an extra byte,
    which can lead to out-of-bounds access. This vulnerability occurs because the
    calculation includes an unnecessary +1, potentially causing memory corruption
    or crashes. To fix this, ensure the end pointer is calculated without the extra
    byte, as shown in the fixed version.
