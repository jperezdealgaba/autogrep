  message: 'The code directly calculates the size of the output buffer without validating
    if the buffer is large enough to hold the data. This can lead to buffer overflow
    vulnerabilities if the output buffer is smaller than the calculated size. To fix
    this, ensure the output buffer size is validated before writing data to it.
