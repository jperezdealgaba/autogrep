  message: 'Detected a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to missing bounds
    check in a while loop.

    This vulnerability occurs when processing STUN messages without verifying the
    attribute count against the maximum allowed.

    An attacker could exploit this to cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading
    to arbitrary code execution or a crash.

    To fix this, ensure the loop checks that the attribute count does not exceed the
    maximum allowed, as shown in the patch.
