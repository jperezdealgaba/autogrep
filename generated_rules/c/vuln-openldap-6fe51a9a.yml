  message: 'The use of `assert(0)` in the code indicates a potential issue where the
    program may terminate abruptly due to an invalid state. This can be dangerous
    as it may lead to denial of service or unexpected behavior in production environments.
    Instead of using `assert(0)`, handle the invalid input gracefully with appropriate
    error handling or logging.
