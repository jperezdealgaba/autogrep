  message: "Detected unsafe strncpy usage that can lead to string truncation without\
    \ proper length checking. \nThis pattern is dangerous because it assumes the source\
    \ string will fit in the destination buffer, \npotentially leading to truncated\
    \ strings and incorrect length calculations. \nThe fix is to use strnlen to check\
    \ the source string length before copying and handle cases \nwhere the string\
    \ is too long.\n"
