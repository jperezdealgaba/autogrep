  message: 'This rule detects a vulnerability where bounds checking is incomplete,
    potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory access. The original code fails to
    check if the width or height values are smaller than the required dimensions,
    which could result in security issues such as buffer overflows. To fix this, ensure
    that both the width and height are validated against the required dimensions.
