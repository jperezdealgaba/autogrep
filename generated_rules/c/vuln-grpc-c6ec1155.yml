  message: 'Detected unsafe integer arithmetic in arena capacity calculation that
    could lead to integer overflow.

    The original code directly multiplies and divides the capacity without checking
    for overflow, which could result in incorrect memory allocation.

    The fix uses GPR_MIN to ensure the result doesn''t exceed UINT8_MAX - 1. Always
    use safe arithmetic operations when dealing with potentially large values.
