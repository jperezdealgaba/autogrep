  message: "The code contains a vulnerability where the block alignment check is insufficient.\
    \ \nThe original check only ensures that blockalign is greater than 7 times the\
    \ number of channels, \nbut it should also ensure that blockalign is at least\
    \ half of samplesperblock times the number of channels. \nThis can lead to incorrect\
    \ block alignment and potential buffer overflows or data corruption. \nTo fix\
    \ this, ensure that blockalign is checked against both conditions.\n"
