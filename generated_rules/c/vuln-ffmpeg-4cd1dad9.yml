  message: 'The use of `av_get_channel_layout_nb_channels` to determine the number
    of channels from the channel layout is incorrect and can lead to incorrect channel
    count calculations. This can result in improper audio processing or memory corruption.
    Use the `channels` field directly from the frame structure instead.
