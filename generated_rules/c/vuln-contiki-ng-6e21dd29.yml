  message: 'Detected a potentially dangerous buffer declaration that does not account
    for the null terminator.

    This can lead to buffer overflows when the string is used, as the null terminator
    will be written outside the allocated buffer.

    To fix this, ensure the buffer size includes space for the null terminator by
    adding +1 to the length.
