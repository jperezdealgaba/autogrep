  message: 'Detected a potential resource leak vulnerability where TIFF file handles
    are not properly cleaned up in error paths. This can lead to resource exhaustion
    and undefined behavior. The issue was fixed by using a centralized error handling
    block with proper cleanup. Ensure all resources are properly freed in error paths.
