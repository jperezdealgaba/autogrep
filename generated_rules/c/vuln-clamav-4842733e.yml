  message: 'The vulnerability arises from directly using the `items` field of a structure
    without subtracting 1, which can lead to incorrect array indexing and potential
    out-of-bounds access. This is dangerous because it can cause memory corruption,
    crashes, or even arbitrary code execution. To fix this, ensure that `items - 1`
    is used when accessing the array to properly account for zero-based indexing.
