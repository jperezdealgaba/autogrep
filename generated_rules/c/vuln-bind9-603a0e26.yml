  message: 'The function `dns_resolver_createfetch2` is vulnerable to recursive DNS
    queries without depth limiting, which could lead to DNS amplification attacks
    or resource exhaustion. This was fixed by introducing `dns_resolver_createfetch3`
    which includes a depth parameter to limit recursion. Update to use `dns_resolver_createfetch3`
    with an appropriate depth limit.
