  message: 'Detected a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to missing length
    check before memcmp.

    This is dangerous because it can lead to out-of-bounds memory access, potentially
    causing crashes or security exploits.

    To fix this, ensure the length of the data being compared matches the size of
    the target buffer.
