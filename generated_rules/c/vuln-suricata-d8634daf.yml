  message: 'Detected a missing check for PKT_STREAM_EST in TCP protocol handling.
    This vulnerability could allow processing of packets that are not part of an established
    stream, potentially leading to security issues such as bypassing security controls
    or processing malformed packets. Always verify that the packet is part of an established
    stream using the PKT_STREAM_EST flag when handling TCP packets.
