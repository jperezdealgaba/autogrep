  message: "Detected unsafe time_t computation that may lead to incorrect time handling.\
    \ \nThe original code attempts to compute the maximum value of time_t by iterating,\n\
    which can result in undefined behavior or incorrect results on different systems.\n\
    The fix properly handles both signed and unsigned time_t types according to POSIX\
