  message: 'The use of `strncpy` without proper length checking can lead to buffer
    overflows or truncation issues. In this case, `strncpy` was replaced with `strcpy`
    after ensuring the destination buffer is large enough to handle the source string.
    This change prevents potential truncation and ensures the string is copied correctly.
    Always validate buffer sizes before using `strcpy` or ensure `strncpy` is used
    with proper length checks.
