  message: 'Directly destroying an image and returning NULL without proper cleanup
    can lead to resource leaks and undefined behavior. This pattern was fixed by using
    a ''goto fail'' statement to ensure consistent cleanup paths. To fix this, ensure
    all error paths use a consistent cleanup mechanism like ''goto fail'' to properly
    release resources.
