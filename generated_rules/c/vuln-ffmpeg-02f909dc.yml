  message: 'The use of `av_image_check_size` without proper dimension setting can
    lead to incorrect image processing or security vulnerabilities. This function
    checks the dimensions but does not set them, which can cause issues in subsequent
    operations. Replace it with `ff_set_dimensions` to ensure proper dimension handling.
