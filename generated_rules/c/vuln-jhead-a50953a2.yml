  message: 'The code contains a potentially unsafe integer overflow check. The comparison
    `OffsetVal < 0` is redundant when `OffsetVal` is declared as an unsigned integer,
    and it can lead to incorrect behavior. This vulnerability could allow for out-of-bounds
    memory access if the check is not properly enforced. To fix this, ensure that
    `OffsetVal` is declared as an unsigned integer and remove the redundant negative
    check.
