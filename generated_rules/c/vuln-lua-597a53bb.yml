  message: 'The vulnerability involves the incorrect use of assignment instead of
    bitwise OR operation for setting the GCSTPGC flag. This can lead to unintended
    behavior in garbage collection, potentially causing memory leaks or crashes. Use
    the bitwise OR operator (|=) to properly set the flag without overwriting other
    bits.
