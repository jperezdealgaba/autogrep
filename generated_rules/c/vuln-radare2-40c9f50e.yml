  message: 'This loop condition may lead to an out-of-bounds read due to insufficient
    bounds checking.

    The condition `j < section->size` does not account for the fact that 8 bytes are
    read at each iteration,

    which could result in reading past the end of the section buffer. The fix ensures
    that there are

    at least 8 bytes remaining before accessing the memory.
