  message: 'Detected potential memory leak in Wireshark dissector code. The use of
    `tvb_memdup` with an explicit cast to `guint8 *` can lead to memory leaks if the
    allocated memory is not properly freed. This vulnerability can cause resource
    exhaustion and potential denial of service. Replace `tvb_memdup` with `tvb_get_string_enc`
    to handle string extraction safely.
