  message: "The code contains an incomplete character range check in a conditional\
    \ statement. \nThis vulnerability arises when only a single character is checked\
    \ instead of a range, which can lead to bypasses or incorrect parsing. \nThe fix\
    \ involves checking for a range of characters (<= '/' and >= ';') to ensure proper\
    \ validation. \nUpdate the condition to use a range check instead of a single\
    \ character comparison.\n"
