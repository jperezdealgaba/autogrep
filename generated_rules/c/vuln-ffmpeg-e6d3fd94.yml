  message: "The vulnerability occurs due to incorrect parameter usage in the `avpriv_request_sample`\
    \ function. \nThe original code uses `track->par`, which is incorrect and could\
    \ lead to undefined behavior or crashes. \nThe fix replaces it with `mov->fc`,\
    \ which is the correct parameter. \nThis issue is dangerous as it could cause\
    \ the application to behave unpredictably or crash when handling multiple independent\
    \ substreams. \nTo fix this, ensure the correct parameter is passed to the function.\n"
