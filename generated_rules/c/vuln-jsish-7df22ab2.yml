  message: 'Direct assignment of the result of `Jsi_StrdupLen` to a structure field
    can lead to memory leaks if the field previously held a dynamically allocated
    string. This is dangerous because it can result in unreleased memory, leading
    to memory exhaustion over time. The fix involves storing the result in a temporary
    variable before assigning it to the structure field.
