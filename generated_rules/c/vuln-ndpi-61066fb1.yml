  message: 'The vulnerability occurs due to a direct calculation of the minimum value
    between the packet length and the size of the buffer. This can lead to incorrect
    calculations and potential buffer overflows. The fix involves calculating the
    difference first and then applying the minimum function. Always ensure intermediate
    calculations are performed separately to avoid such issues.
