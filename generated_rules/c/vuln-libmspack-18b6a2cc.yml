  message: 'The code directly calls `ENSURE_BITS(16)` without checking if `bits_left`
    is zero, which can lead to buffer underflow. This is dangerous because it may
    cause out-of-bounds memory access, potentially leading to crashes or security
    vulnerabilities. The fix is to check if `bits_left` is zero before calling `ENSURE_BITS(16)`.
