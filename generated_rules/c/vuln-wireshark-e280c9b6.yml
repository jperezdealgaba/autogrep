  message: 'Detected a potential DNS parsing loop vulnerability. The original code
    checks for

    character processing count against data size, which can lead to infinite loops

    if the DNS message contains circular pointers. This can cause denial of service

    or excessive resource consumption. The fix introduces a pointer count mechanism

    to detect both direct and indirect loops. Replace the character count check with

    a pointer count check to prevent this vulnerability.
