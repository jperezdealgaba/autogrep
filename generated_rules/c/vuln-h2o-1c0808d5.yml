  message: 'The function `close_connection` is called without checking its return
    value, which could lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The function
    was changed to return an integer to indicate success or failure, but the calling
    code does not handle this return value. This could result in ignoring critical
    errors during connection closure. To fix this, ensure that the return value of
    `close_connection` is checked and handled appropriately.
