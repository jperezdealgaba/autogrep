  message: 'The vulnerability involves incorrect handling of DNS validator options,
    specifically the DNS_VALIDATOR_DEFER flag. The original code uses an INSIST assertion
    to check if the flag is set, but it does not properly handle the case where the
    flag should be toggled. This can lead to improper validation handling and potential
    manipulation of DNS messages. The fix involves correctly setting or clearing the
    flag based on the context. Ensure that DNS validator options are properly managed
    to prevent concurrent manipulation of DNS message structures.
