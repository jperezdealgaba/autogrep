  message: 'The function `yc_poly_emulator` is called without a `max_emu` parameter,
    which can lead to unbounded emulation and potential security vulnerabilities.
    This issue was fixed by adding a `max_emu` parameter to limit the emulation length.
    Always ensure that emulation functions have bounds to prevent excessive resource
    consumption or out-of-bounds access.
