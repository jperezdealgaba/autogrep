  message: 'Detected use of fixed-size buffer without proper dynamic allocation. This
    can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the input size exceeds the buffer
    capacity. The vulnerability was fixed by replacing the fixed-size buffer with
    dynamically allocated memory using g_new0 and ensuring proper cleanup with g_free.
