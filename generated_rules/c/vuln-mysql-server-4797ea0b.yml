  message: 'Incorrect handling of LIST in mysql_prune_stmt_list() can lead to memory
    corruption or use-after-free vulnerabilities. The original code iterates over
    a linked list without properly managing the list''s state during deletion, which
    can result in undefined behavior. The fix involves using a while loop and properly
    deleting elements from the list. To fix this issue, ensure that list elements
    are properly deleted during iteration to prevent memory corruption.
