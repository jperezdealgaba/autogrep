  message: "The use of `mrb_raisef` with a format string in this context can lead\
    \ to potential formatting vulnerabilities. \nThis is dangerous because it could\
    \ allow for format string attacks, which might lead to memory corruption or information\
    \ disclosure.\nUse `mrb_raise` instead, which does not involve format string processing.\n"
