  message: 'The function `fix_identifier_with_newline` is used without a `freemem`
    parameter,

    which can lead to memory management issues. This function was modified to include

    a `freemem` parameter to properly handle dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

    Using the old version without this parameter can cause memory leaks or undefined

    behavior. Always use the updated version that includes the `freemem` parameter.
