  message: 'The code creates an invalid component when `comp_kind` is `ICAL_NO_COMPONENT`,
    which can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This vulnerability was fixed
    by removing the creation of the invalid component. To fix this, ensure that no
    invalid components are created when parsing fails.
