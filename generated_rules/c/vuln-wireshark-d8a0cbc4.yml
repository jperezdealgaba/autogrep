  message: 'The loop starts at index 1 and uses ''i <= item_count'' as the condition,
    which can lead to off-by-one errors and potential out-of-bounds access. This is
    dangerous because it can cause memory corruption or crashes. To fix this, start
    the loop at index 0 and use ''i < item_count'' as the condition, adjusting any
    index usage inside the loop accordingly.
