  message: 'Detected conditional inclusion of inttypes.h based on HAVE_INTTYPES_H
    macro.

    This can lead to portability issues and potential undefined behavior if inttypes.h
    is not included when needed.

    Remove the conditional inclusion and always include inttypes.h directly to ensure
    consistent behavior.
