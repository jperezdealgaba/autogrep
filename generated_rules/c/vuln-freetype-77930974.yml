  message: 'This rule detects a vulnerability where the absence of a specific table
    (TTAG_CFF) is checked without first ensuring the presence of another required
    table (TTAG_glyf). This can lead to incorrect handling of font data, potentially
    causing crashes or undefined behavior. The fix involves adding a check for the
    presence of the TTAG_glyf table before checking for the TTAG_CFF table.
