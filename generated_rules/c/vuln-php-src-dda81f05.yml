  message: 'The code directly uses entry->filename without proper path sanitization,
    which could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities. The patch adds proper path
    sanitization by using a virtual_file_ex function to strip ''..'' from the path
    and restrict it to be under the destination directory. Always sanitize file paths
    before using them in file operations.
