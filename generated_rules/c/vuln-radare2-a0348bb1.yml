  message: 'The function `r_hex_bin2str` is being called with an incorrect length
    parameter, which could lead to buffer overflows or incorrect data processing.
    The length should be calculated separately and explicitly passed to the function
    to ensure correctness. This vulnerability can cause memory corruption or unexpected
    behavior in the application.
