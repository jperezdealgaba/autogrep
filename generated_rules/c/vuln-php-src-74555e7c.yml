  message: 'The use of ''free()'' instead of ''efree()'' can lead to memory management
    issues in PHP extensions.

    ''free()'' should not be used directly in PHP extensions as it bypasses PHP''s
    internal memory management system.

    Replace ''free()'' with ''efree()'' to ensure proper memory handling within PHP''s
    memory management system.
