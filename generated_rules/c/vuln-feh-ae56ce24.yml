  message: 'The use of the ''-N'' flag with wget can lead to unsafe file operations
    by relying on server-provided timestamps, which can be manipulated. This can result
    in the overwriting of files with potentially malicious content. The vulnerability
    was fixed by removing the ''-N'' flag and using ''--cache=off'' instead, which
    ensures that the file is always downloaded fresh without relying on server timestamps.
