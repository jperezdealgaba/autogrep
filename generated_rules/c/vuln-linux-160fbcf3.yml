  message: 'Direct assignment to skb->len is unsafe and can lead to incorrect packet
    handling. Use skb_put() instead to properly manage the length of the socket buffer.

    This vulnerability can cause memory corruption or incorrect packet processing,
    leading to potential security issues or crashes.

    Fix: Replace direct assignment with skb_put(skb, len).
