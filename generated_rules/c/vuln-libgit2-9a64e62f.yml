  message: "The variable 'is_valid' was incorrectly initialized, leading to potential\
    \ security issues. \nThe original code only checked for non-certificate errors,\
    \ which could allow invalid certificates to be accepted. \nThis vulnerability\
    \ could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks. \nThe fix ensures that the variable\
