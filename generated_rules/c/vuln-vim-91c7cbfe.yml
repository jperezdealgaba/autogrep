  message: 'Direct assignment of memory pointer without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or use-after-free vulnerabilities. The pointer should be handled
    through the dedicated free_eval_tofree_later() function which ensures proper memory
    management. Use free_eval_tofree_later() instead of direct assignment and free
