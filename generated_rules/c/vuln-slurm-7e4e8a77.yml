  message: 'The use of `unpackstr_xmalloc` with an uninitialized `uint32_t` variable
    can lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption. This function attempts to
    read a string from a buffer, but the size parameter is uninitialized, which can
    result in incorrect memory allocation or access. The fix replaces this with `safe_unpackstr`,
    which handles the string extraction safely and correctly. Always ensure that variables
    used in memory operations are properly initialized and validated.
