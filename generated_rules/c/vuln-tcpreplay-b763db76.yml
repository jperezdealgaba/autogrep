  message: 'Detected an insecure payload length check in packet processing code. The
    original check allows for invalid payload lengths that could lead to buffer overflows
    or incorrect packet handling. The vulnerability occurs when the payload length
    is not properly validated against the minimum required size for the packet type
    (e.g., IPv4/IPv6 headers). This could allow processing of malformed packets or
    insufficient data, potentially leading to crashes or security issues. To fix,
    ensure payload length checks properly validate against the minimum required size
    for the specific packet type being processed.
