  message: 'The use of a hardcoded array size (64) for `jpc_tsfb_band_t` can lead
    to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. This is dangerous because it may allow an
    attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. Replace the hardcoded
    size with a defined constant (e.g., JPC_MAXBANDS) to ensure the array size is
    properly managed.
