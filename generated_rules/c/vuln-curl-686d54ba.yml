  message: 'The vulnerability occurs when the full size of a buffer is passed to a
    function without accounting for the null terminator, which can lead to buffer
    overflows. This is dangerous because it can result in memory corruption, crashes,
    or even arbitrary code execution. To fix this, subtract 1 from the buffer size
    to ensure space for the null terminator.
