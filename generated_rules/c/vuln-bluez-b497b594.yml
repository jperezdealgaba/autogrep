  message: 'The code unconditionally sets the adapter to non-discoverable without
    checking if it was set temporarily by discovery. This can lead to incorrect state
    management and potential security issues where the adapter remains discoverable
    when it should not. Fix by adding a condition to check `current_settings` before
    modifying the discoverable state.
