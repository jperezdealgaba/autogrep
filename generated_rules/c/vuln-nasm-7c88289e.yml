  message: "Detected a potential vulnerability where the wrong pointer is passed to\
    \ `set_text_free`. \nThis can lead to incorrect memory management, potentially\
    \ causing memory leaks or undefined behavior.\nThe fix involves using a separate\
    \ pointer (`from`) to track the allocated memory and pass it to `set_text_free`.\n"
