  message: 'The use of `strdupa` for dynamic string allocation is dangerous because
    it uses stack memory, which can lead to stack overflow vulnerabilities. Additionally,
    the code does not properly handle memory cleanup, potentially leading to memory
    leaks. Replace `strdupa` with `strdup` and ensure proper memory management using
    `_cleanup_free_` to avoid these issues.
