  message: 'Detected unsafe use of NULL as first argument in tvb_get_bits_array().
    This can lead to memory management issues since the function expects a valid memory
    pool pointer. Always use wmem_packet_scope() or another appropriate memory pool
    to ensure proper memory management and prevent potential crashes or memory leaks.
