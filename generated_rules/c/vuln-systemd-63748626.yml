  message: 'The original code fails to properly handle asynchronous PolicyKit replies,
    leading to potential memory leaks and incorrect error handling. The patch introduces
    a deferred event source to clean up resources after the asynchronous operation
    completes. Ensure proper cleanup of resources in asynchronous operations to prevent
    memory leaks and improve error handling.
