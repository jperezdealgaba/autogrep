  message: 'The code contains an incorrect assertion that checks the null terminator
    at the wrong index in a wide character string. This could lead to incorrect assumptions
    about the string''s length, potentially causing buffer overflows or other undefined
    behavior. The fix is to check the correct index (2) instead of (3) to ensure proper
    string termination validation.
