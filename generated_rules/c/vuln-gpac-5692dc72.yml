  message: 'A missing bounds check in the AC3 reframe filter could lead to out-of-bounds
    memory access. This vulnerability occurs when the code processes data without
    verifying that the remaining buffer size is sufficient for the frame size. This
    could result in memory corruption or crashes. To fix this, always ensure the remaining
    buffer size is checked against the frame size before processing.
