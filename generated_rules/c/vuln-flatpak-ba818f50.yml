  message: 'Detected unsafe use of `g_bytes_new` with `strlen + 1` which can lead
    to buffer overflows or incorrect size calculations. This vulnerability occurs
    when the size of a string is incorrectly calculated by adding 1 to the result
    of `strlen`, potentially including the null terminator twice. This can lead to
    memory corruption or incorrect data handling. Always use `strlen` directly without
    adding 1 when passing the size to `g_bytes_new`.
