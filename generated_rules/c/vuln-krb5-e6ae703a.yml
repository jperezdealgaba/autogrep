  message: 'The code is vulnerable to a buffer underflow due to insufficient validation
    of the token length. This can lead to memory corruption or unauthorized access.
    The patch increases the minimum required length from 14 to 22 to ensure proper
    validation. Always validate buffer lengths to prevent such vulnerabilities.
