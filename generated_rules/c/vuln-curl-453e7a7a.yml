  message: 'The code checks for both `errno` and `*endp == '':''` in the same condition,
    which can lead to undefined behavior if `errno` is set and `endp` is NULL. This
    can cause a null pointer dereference or other unexpected behavior. To fix this,
    separate the checks into distinct conditions, handling `errno` first and then
    checking `*endp == '':''`.
