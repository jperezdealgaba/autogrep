  message: 'The function `asyncCloseClientOnOutputBufferLimitReached` has been replaced
    with `closeClientOnOutputBufferLimitReached` to handle client closure more safely.
    The old function did not provide control over whether the client should be closed
    immediately or asynchronously, which could lead to unsafe client handling. Use
    `closeClientOnOutputBufferLimitReached` with an appropriate `async` parameter
    to ensure safe client closure.
