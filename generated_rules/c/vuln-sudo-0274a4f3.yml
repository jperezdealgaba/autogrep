  message: 'The code uses an uninitialized environment editor variable without proper
    error handling.

    This can lead to undefined behavior when the editor is not found. The fix initializes

    the variable and adds specific error handling for ENOENT. Always initialize variables

    and handle specific error conditions explicitly.
