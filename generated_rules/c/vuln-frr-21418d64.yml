  message: 'The function `bgp_attr_check` is called without the required `length`
    parameter, which can lead to improper validation of BGP attributes. This vulnerability
    could allow an attacker to bypass security checks, potentially leading to unauthorized
    access or other security issues. To fix this, ensure that the `bgp_attr_check`
    function is called with all required parameters, including `length`.
