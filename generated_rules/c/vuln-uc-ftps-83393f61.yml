  message: 'This rule detects a vulnerability where the control state check in the
    FTP server is incorrectly using == FTPs_STATE_LOGOUT instead of != FTPs_STATE_LOGIN.
    This could lead to unauthorized access or improper session handling. The fix changes
    the condition to != FTPs_STATE_LOGIN to ensure proper state validation. Always
    validate session states correctly to prevent security issues.
