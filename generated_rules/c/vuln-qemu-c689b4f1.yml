  message: 'Using `fopen` directly can lead to security vulnerabilities such as TOCTOU
    (Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use) attacks and improper file permissions. The function
    `safe_open_or_create` should be used instead to ensure proper file handling, including
    exclusive file creation and correct permission settings.
