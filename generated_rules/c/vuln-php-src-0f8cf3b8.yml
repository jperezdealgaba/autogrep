  message: 'The code uses memchr() to search for ''&'' characters in a string but
    doesn''t account for previously scanned portions of the buffer. This can lead
    to incorrect parsing of URL query parameters and potential security vulnerabilities.
    The fix adds an ''already_scanned'' field to track processed portions of the buffer.
    Always track and skip already processed portions of buffers when parsing.
