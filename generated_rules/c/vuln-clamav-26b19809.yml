  message: 'The variable `max_jmp_loop` is set to a low value (100000), which can
    lead to insufficient loop iteration limits. This can cause the program to terminate
    prematurely or fail to handle large inputs properly. Increase the value of `max_jmp_loop`
    to 100000000 to ensure adequate loop iteration limits.
