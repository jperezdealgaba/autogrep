  message: 'The vulnerability involves an integer overflow in the calculation of strips
    per plane in the TIFF library. The original calculation can lead to an overflow
    when td_imagelength and rowsperstrip are large, potentially causing memory corruption
    or other undefined behavior. The fix replaces the calculation with the TIFFhowmany_32_maxuint_compat
    function, which safely handles the division. To fix this, replace the vulnerable
    calculation with the safe function.
