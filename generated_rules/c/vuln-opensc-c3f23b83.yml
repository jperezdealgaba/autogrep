  message: 'Detected potential integer underflow vulnerability. Subtracting 1 from
    a variable without checking if it is greater than 0 can lead to underflow, which
    may cause unexpected behavior or security issues. Always ensure the variable is
    greater than 0 before performing the subtraction. The fix involves using a ternary
    operator to check the value before subtracting.
