  message: 'The code does not properly validate the crop dimensions against the source
    image dimensions, which could lead to buffer overflows or invalid memory access.
    Ensure that the crop dimensions are validated against the source image dimensions
    before performing the crop operation. The fix involves checking if the crop dimensions
    exceed the source image dimensions and adjusting them accordingly.
