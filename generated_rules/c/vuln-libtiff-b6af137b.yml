  message: 'The code uses an assert statement to check if a value is within the 32-bit
    range, which can be optimized out in release builds, leading to potential security
    vulnerabilities. Instead, proper error handling should be implemented to ensure
    the value is validated at runtime. This vulnerability could allow an attacker
    to pass illegal values that bypass the assert check, potentially leading to undefined
    behavior or crashes.
