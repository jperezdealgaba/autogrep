  message: 'The length calculation for TPDUs in the ISO/OSI transport protocol dissector
    is incorrect, potentially leading to buffer overflows or incorrect packet parsing.
    The original code incorrectly adds the length indicator to the remaining buffer
    length, which can result in an overestimation of the TPDU length. This can cause
    security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or incorrect packet dissection.
    The fix uses `tvb_reported_length_remaining` to correctly determine the length
    of the TPDU based on the reported length of the containing PDU.
