  message: 'Detected a missing buffer length check after advancing the buffer pointer.
    This vulnerability could lead to buffer overreads when processing TCP headers,
    potentially causing crashes or information disclosure. Always verify the remaining
    buffer size after advancing the pointer to ensure it contains enough data for
    the expected structure.
