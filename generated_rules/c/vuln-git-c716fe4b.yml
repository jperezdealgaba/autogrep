  message: 'Detected potential URL component injection vulnerability. The code accesses
    credential fields

    directly without checking for newline characters, which could lead to injection
    attacks.

    The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious input via newline characters
    in URL components.

    To fix, use `credential_from_url_gently` which includes proper validation of URL
    components.
