  message: 'Detected insecure file creation without proper permissions. This can lead
    to

    security vulnerabilities where sensitive files are created with overly permissive

    access rights, allowing unauthorized users to read or modify them. To fix this,

    use umask to restrict permissions during file creation and explicitly set

    appropriate permissions with chmod.
