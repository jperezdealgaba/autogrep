  message: 'Direct use of `nc->info->receive_iov` can lead to security vulnerabilities
    due to potential bypass of packet validation and processing. This method should
    be replaced with `qemu_receive_packet_iov` which ensures proper packet handling
    and validation. Always use the recommended API to maintain security and consistency
    in packet processing.
