  message: 'The code contains a potentially unsafe use of `gst_object_unref` with
    a variable that may not be properly managed, leading to potential double-free
    or use-after-free vulnerabilities. This can cause crashes or security exploits.
    Ensure that the object being unreferenced is properly managed and not unrefed
