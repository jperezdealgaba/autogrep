  message: 'The function `look_for_existing_users_sync` is called without checking
    its return value, which can lead to undefined behavior if the function fails.
    This vulnerability could allow the system to continue operating in an inconsistent
    state. To fix this, ensure the return value is checked and handle the failure
    appropriately, such as exiting with a failure status.
