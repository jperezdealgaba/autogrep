  message: 'The vulnerability involves a division operation that could lead to incorrect
    behavior when the size of the first hash table is smaller than the second. This
    could cause incorrect resizing decisions in the dictionary, potentially leading
    to performance issues or unexpected behavior. The fix ensures that the ratio is
    checked in both directions, preventing incorrect resizing decisions.
