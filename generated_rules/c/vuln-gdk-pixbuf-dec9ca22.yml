  message: 'This rule detects integer overflow vulnerabilities in C code where an
    arithmetic operation is performed without checking for potential overflow, leading
    to undefined behavior. The vulnerability occurs when adding two integers without
    verifying if the result exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in the resulting
    variable. This can lead to security issues such as memory corruption or crashes.
    To fix this, ensure that the addition operation is checked for potential overflow
    before performing the calculation.
