  message: 'Detected incorrect usage of `vct_iscrlf` with a dereferenced pointer.
    This can lead to incorrect parsing of HTTP headers, potentially causing security
    vulnerabilities such as HTTP request smuggling. The function `vct_iscrlf` expects
    a pointer, not a dereferenced value. Fix by removing the dereference operator
    (*) when passing the pointer to `vct_iscrlf`.
