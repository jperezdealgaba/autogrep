  message: 'The function `addReply` is being used to send a response header directly,
    which can lead to potential vulnerabilities due to incorrect handling of the response
    length. This can cause issues with protocol compliance and buffer overflows. Use
    `addReplyProto` instead, which explicitly handles the length of the response to
    ensure proper protocol handling.
