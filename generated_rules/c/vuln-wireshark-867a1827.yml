  message: 'Detected unsafe length calculation in Wireshark''s protocol dissector.
    The original code uses `tvb_captured_length_remaining` followed by a manual check
    for negative values, which can lead to incorrect handling of buffer boundaries.
    This could potentially cause security vulnerabilities by allowing improper buffer
    access. Use `tvb_ensure_captured_length_remaining` instead, which properly validates
    the length and throws an exception if the offset is past the buffer end.
