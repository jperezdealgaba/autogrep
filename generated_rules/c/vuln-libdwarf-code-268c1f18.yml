  message: 'The code uses DECODE_LEB128_UWORD without bounds checking, which can lead
    to buffer overflows. This vulnerability can be exploited to read or write out-of-bounds
    memory, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution. Always use
    the checked version DECODE_LEB128_UWORD_CK which includes bounds checking and
    error handling.
