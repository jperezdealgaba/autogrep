  message: 'The use of `fgets()` without proper line handling can lead to incomplete
    or partial lines being processed, which may cause security vulnerabilities. The
    function `fgets()` does not guarantee that the entire line is read, especially
    if the line is longer than the buffer size. This can result in incorrect parsing
    or processing of data. To fix this, use a custom function like `get_line()` that
    ensures complete lines are read and processed.
