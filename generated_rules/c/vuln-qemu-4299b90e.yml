  message: 'The function `cirrus_do_copy` was previously declared as `void` and did
    not return any value, which could lead to undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities
    when handling invalid parameters. The function should return an integer to indicate
    success or failure, especially when checking for invalid conditions like zero
    depth or pitch. Update the function to return an integer and handle error conditions
    appropriately.
