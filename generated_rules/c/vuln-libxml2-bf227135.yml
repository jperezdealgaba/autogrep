  message: 'The code checks for invalid UTF-8 sequences by only verifying if the first
    byte is less than 0xC0, which is insufficient. This can lead to incorrect validation
    of UTF-8 encoded characters, potentially causing security vulnerabilities such
    as injection attacks or memory corruption. The fix involves a more comprehensive
    check that verifies the structure of the UTF-8 sequence according to the UTF-8
    encoding rules.
