  message: 'This rule detects a potential out-of-bounds read vulnerability where a
    backslash character is checked without ensuring the next character is not the
    null terminator. This can lead to reading beyond the intended memory boundary,
    causing undefined behavior or crashes. Always check for the null terminator before
    accessing the next character.
