  message: 'Potential null pointer dereference and buffer overflow vulnerability detected.

    The code uses strlcpy with a source pointer that is not checked for NULL,

    which could lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, adding 1 to the length

    could cause a buffer overflow if the source data is exactly the length of the

    destination buffer. Always check for NULL pointers before copying data and

    use memcpy with the correct length to avoid overflow.
