  message: 'This rule detects an incorrect buffer size calculation that could lead
    to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The original calculation uses `oldsize + (oldsize
    >> 1) + 4`, which might not allocate enough space in certain scenarios. The fix
    changes the constant to `5` to ensure sufficient buffer size. This vulnerability
    is dangerous because it could allow attackers to overwrite adjacent memory, potentially
    leading to arbitrary code execution. To fix this, ensure the buffer size calculation
    includes an appropriate safety margin.
