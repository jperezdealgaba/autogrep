  message: 'The variable ''backsize'' is declared as a signed integer, which can lead
    to integer overflow vulnerabilities when handling large values. This is dangerous
    because it can cause incorrect memory allocations or buffer overflows. To fix
    this, declare ''backsize'' as an unsigned integer to safely handle larger values.
