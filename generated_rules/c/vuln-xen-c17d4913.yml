  message: 'The code does not check for memory allocation using `domain_memory_add_chk`
    before processing watch events, which could lead to memory exhaustion or denial
    of service. This vulnerability was fixed by adding memory checks before processing
    watch events. Always ensure memory allocation checks are in place when handling
    potentially large or unbounded data.
