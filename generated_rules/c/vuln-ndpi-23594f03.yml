  message: "Detected a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient\
    \ buffer size. \nThe buffer 'rdnSeqBuf' was originally allocated with a size of\
    \ 1024 bytes, which may be insufficient for certain TLS operations, leading to\
    \ buffer overflow. \nThe fix increases the buffer size to 2048 bytes to prevent\
    \ this issue. \nAlways ensure buffers are appropriately sized to handle the maximum\
    \ expected data.\n"
