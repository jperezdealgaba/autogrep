  message: 'The vulnerable code conditionally updates the return value based on a
    comparison, which can lead to incorrect behavior or security issues. This can
    be dangerous as it may result in unexpected program behavior or potential exploitation.
    The fix removes the conditional check to ensure the return value is always updated
    correctly.
