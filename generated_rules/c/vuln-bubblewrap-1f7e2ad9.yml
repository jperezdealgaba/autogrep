  message: 'Detected a call to `drop_privs` with only one argument, which may lead
    to privilege escalation vulnerabilities. The function now requires a second argument
    to properly handle UID changes. This is dangerous because it may allow an attacker
    to retain elevated privileges in certain scenarios. Always pass both arguments
    to `drop_privs` to ensure proper privilege dropping.
