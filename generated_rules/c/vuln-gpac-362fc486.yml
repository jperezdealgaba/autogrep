  message: 'The code checks for the existence of views using ''num_views'' instead
    of ''views''.

    This could lead to null pointer dereference or incorrect logic since ''num_views''

    might be non-zero even when ''views'' is null. Always check the pointer itself

    rather than just its size/count field.
