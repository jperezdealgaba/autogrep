  message: 'The condition checks for the presence of curly braces at the beginning
    and end of a string using the logical AND operator (&&) instead of the logical
    OR operator (||). This can lead to incorrect validation, potentially allowing
    malformed input to bypass checks. Use the logical OR operator (||) to ensure that
    either condition being true results in the check failing.
