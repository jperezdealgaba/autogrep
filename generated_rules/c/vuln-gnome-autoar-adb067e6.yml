  message: 'Detected insecure path validation in GNOME Autoar. The original code only
    checks if the extracted file is equal to or has the destination directory as a
    prefix, which can be bypassed with symbolic links. This could lead to arbitrary
    file write vulnerabilities. The fix involves resolving symbolic links and ensuring
    the file is actually inside the destination directory. Use the ''is_valid_filename''
    function to properly validate paths.
