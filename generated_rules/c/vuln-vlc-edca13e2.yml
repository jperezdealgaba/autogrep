  message: 'This pattern detects a potential vulnerability where a variable is assigned
    and then immediately modified in a separate statement. This can lead to confusion
    and potential errors in code logic. The fix consolidates the operation into a
    single statement, improving clarity and reducing the risk of errors. Always combine
    such operations into a single statement to ensure code correctness and maintainability.
