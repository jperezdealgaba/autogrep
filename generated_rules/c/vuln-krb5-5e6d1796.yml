  message: 'The code fails to handle the case where the key is expired (KRB5KDC_ERR_KEY_EXP),
    which could lead to security vulnerabilities by allowing expired keys to be used.
    This was fixed by adding a check for KRB5KDC_ERR_KEY_EXP in the condition. Ensure
    that all relevant error codes are properly handled in authentication checks.
