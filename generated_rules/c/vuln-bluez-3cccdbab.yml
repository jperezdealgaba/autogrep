  message: 'This pattern detects a missing check for classic bonded devices in the
    Bluetooth input profile, which could allow unauthorized connections. The vulnerability
    occurs when the code fails to verify if a device is bonded before processing its
    connection request. This can lead to security risks where unauthenticated devices
    gain access. The fix requires adding a check for `classic_bonded_only` in conjunction
    with the existing subclass check.
