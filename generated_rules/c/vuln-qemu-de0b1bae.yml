  message: 'The loop increment in this code uses a step size of 16, which may lead
    to incorrect processing of data in 4-byte increments. This can cause vulnerabilities
    in pointer authentication (PAuth) logic, potentially leading to security issues
    such as improper memory access or authentication bypass. The fix changes the step
    size to 4 to ensure proper handling of 4-byte data chunks. Always ensure loop
    increments match the data size being processed.
