  message: 'The code directly constructs a TDB_DATA key from node->name, which can
    lead to incorrect key handling and potential data corruption. Instead, use the
    node->key directly, which is properly managed and ensures consistency.

    This vulnerability is dangerous because it can result in incorrect data deletion
    or modification, potentially leading to system instability or security issues.

    Fix: Use node->key directly instead of constructing the key manually.
