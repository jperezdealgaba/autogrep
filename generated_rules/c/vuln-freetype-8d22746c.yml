  message: 'The vulnerability occurs due to a lack of bounds checking when assigning
    `mask->end_point` to a variable. This can lead to out-of-bounds access if `mask->end_point`
    exceeds the actual number of points in the glyph. To fix this, ensure that `mask->end_point`
    is within the bounds of `glyph->num_points` by using a conditional check.
