  message: 'The function `opj_j2k_write_sot` is called without checking the size of
    the output buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. This is
    dangerous because it can allow attackers to overwrite adjacent memory, potentially
    leading to arbitrary code execution or crashes. Always pass and validate the total
    data size parameter to ensure the buffer is large enough to handle the data being
    written.
