  message: 'The use of `g_assert_not_reached()` in network handling code can lead
    to abrupt termination of the program when encountering unsupported offloads. This
    is dangerous as it can be exploited to cause denial of service. Instead, use `qemu_log_mask()`
    to log the event and handle it gracefully.
