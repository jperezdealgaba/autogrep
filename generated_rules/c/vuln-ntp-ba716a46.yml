  message: 'The code uses REQUIRE to check if the length of a string is less than
    the size of a buffer, but this is dangerous because REQUIRE is not a standard
    C function and may not handle the condition safely. This can lead to buffer overflows
    if the condition is not met. Replace REQUIRE with an explicit check and handle
    the condition properly.
