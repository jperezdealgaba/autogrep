  message: 'The code contains a null pointer dereference vulnerability. The check
    for `st == NULL` was removed, which could lead to a crash if `st` is null. This
    vulnerability occurs in the handling of NAT traversal in IKEv1. To fix this, ensure
    proper null checks are in place before accessing structure members.
