  message: 'Detected a potential out-of-bounds array access vulnerability. The code
    checks for a carriage return followed by a line feed without verifying if the
    next index is within bounds. This could lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption.
    To fix, ensure the index is within the valid range by adding a bounds check before
    accessing the array.
