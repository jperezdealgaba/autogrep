  message: 'This code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write due to insufficient
    boundary checks.

    The condition does not verify if `epos` is within the bounds of `l->len`, which
    could lead to memory corruption.

    To fix this, ensure that `epos` is checked against `l->len` before assignment.
