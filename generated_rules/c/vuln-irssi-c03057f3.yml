  message: 'The function `special_push_collector` is called with a NULL argument,
    which can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This is dangerous because it
    can cause the application to terminate unexpectedly or behave in unpredictable
    ways. To fix this, ensure that `special_push_collector` is called with a valid
    argument.
