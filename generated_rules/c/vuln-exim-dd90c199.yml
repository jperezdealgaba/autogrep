  message: 'The use of `clearenv()` can lead to undefined behavior on certain operating
    systems (e.g., crashes on OS X, doesn''t work on FreeBSD 7.0, or Haiku OS). Instead,
    the environment should be cleared by setting `*environ = NULL` after checking
    if `environ` is not NULL. This ensures compatibility across different platforms.
