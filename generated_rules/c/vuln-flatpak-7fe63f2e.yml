  message: 'The function `flatpak_context_set_persistent` is being called without
    proper validation of the `PATH` parameter, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
    The patch adds validation for non-graphical and non-UTF8 characters in paths to
    prevent potential exploits. Always validate paths using `flatpak_validate_path_characters`
    and propagate errors properly.
