  message: 'Detected a potential out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This occurs when
    data is read without proper bounds checking, which can lead to memory corruption
    or information disclosure. The fix involves using a macro `ERR_IF_DATA_OOB` to
    ensure bounds checking is consistently applied. Always validate data offsets before
    accessing memory.
