  message: 'The ternary operator is incorrectly used to set a boolean value, which
    can lead to logical errors. The condition should be negated to ensure the correct
    boolean assignment. This can cause unexpected behavior in the program logic. Fix
    by inverting the condition and swapping the TRUE and FALSE values.
