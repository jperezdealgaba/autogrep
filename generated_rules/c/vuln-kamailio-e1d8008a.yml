  message: 'This vulnerability occurs when the size calculation does not account for
    an additional byte, potentially leading to buffer overflow issues. This is dangerous
    as it can result in memory corruption, crashes, or even arbitrary code execution.
    To fix this, ensure that the size calculation includes the necessary additional
    byte.
