  message: 'The access control check in the code is incomplete, potentially allowing
    unauthorized access to job-related data. The original condition only checks for
    admin privileges and the private data flag, but it does not account for additional
    job condition flags (JOBCOND_FLAG_SCRIPT and JOBCOND_FLAG_ENV). This can lead
    to information disclosure or unauthorized access. To fix this, ensure the condition
    includes checks for all relevant job condition flags.
