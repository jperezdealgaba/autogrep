  message: 'The vulnerability is caused by passing a hardcoded value of 0 as the options
    string to jas_image_decode. This can lead to improper handling of image decoding
    options, potentially resulting in security issues such as buffer overflows or
    improper memory access. The fix involves passing a properly constructed options
    string (optstr) to the function. Always validate and sanitize input parameters
    when dealing with image decoding operations.
