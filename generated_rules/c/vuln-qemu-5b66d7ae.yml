  message: 'Detected a potential integer overflow vulnerability in memory boundary
    checks.

    The original code fails to account for the full range of possible memory addresses,

    which could lead to out-of-bounds memory access. The fixed version correctly

    calculates the minimum address and checks for valid bounds.
