  message: 'This vulnerability occurs due to an incorrect boundary check in a memory
    comparison operation.

    The original code uses `>=` which can lead to a buffer overflow if the condition
    is met exactly.

    This is dangerous as it can allow an attacker to read or write beyond the allocated
    memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

    To fix this, replace `>=` with `>` to ensure proper boundary checking.
