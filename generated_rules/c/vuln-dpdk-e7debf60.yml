  message: 'The code incorrectly checks if a file descriptor is greater than 0 instead
    of greater than or equal to 0. This can lead to resource leaks if the file descriptor
    is not properly closed when it is 0. The correct check should be `if (dev->inflight_info->fd
    >= 0)` to ensure all valid file descriptors are handled correctly. This vulnerability
    can cause resource exhaustion and potential security issues.
