  message: "The code fails to check for an upper bound on the length of the Section\
    \ Header Block in pcapng dump files, which could lead to excessive memory allocation\
    \ or denial of service. \nThe vulnerability is dangerous because it allows potentially\
    \ malicious input to cause memory exhaustion or crash the application. \nTo fix\
    \ this, ensure that the length is checked against a reasonable maximum value (e.g.,\
    \ BT_SHB_INSANE_MAX).\n"
