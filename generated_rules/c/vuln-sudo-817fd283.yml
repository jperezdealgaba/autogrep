  message: 'The function sudo_ttyname_scan() was vulnerable to a security issue where
    it

    would perform a breadth-first scan of directories without checking if they

    were world-writable. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the search

    path and potentially cause the function to return an incorrect or malicious

    tty device. The fix removes the breadth-first scan and adds a check for

    world-writable directories. Update the code to use the fixed version of

    sudo_ttyname_scan() without the ''builtin'' parameter.
