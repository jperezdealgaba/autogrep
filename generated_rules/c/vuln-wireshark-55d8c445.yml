  message: 'The use of `(gint)tvb_ensure_captured_length_remaining` is potentially
    dangerous as it may lead to integer overflow or truncation issues. This can cause
    incorrect length calculations and lead to security vulnerabilities such as buffer
    overflows or data corruption. Replace it with `tvb_captured_length_remaining`
    to avoid casting and ensure proper length handling.
