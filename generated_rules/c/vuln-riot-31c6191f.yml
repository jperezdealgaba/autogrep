  message: 'Detected a direct check of `arq_timeout_event.msg.content.ptr` which is
    unsafe as it does not verify if the event is scheduled. This can lead to incorrect
    state management and potential use-after-free vulnerabilities. Use the `_arq_scheduled`
    function to safely check if the event is scheduled.
