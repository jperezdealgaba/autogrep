  message: 'Detected use of deprecated parse_fix_phrase with buffer parameters. This
    pattern is vulnerable to buffer overflows due to fixed-size buffers. The function
    has been updated to handle memory allocation internally, removing the risk of
    buffer overflows. To fix, remove the buffer and buffer_size parameters and use
    the updated version of parse_fix_phrase.
