  message: 'This rule detects a vulnerability where the size calculation for data
    allocation is incorrect, leading to potential buffer overflows or underflows.
    The original code used a constant value of 26, which was insufficient and could
    result in memory corruption. The fix changes this value to 28 to ensure proper
    allocation. To fix this, update the constant value to 28 in the size calculation.
