  message: 'This pattern detects a potential out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the
    YAJL library. The original code increments ''end'' before checking the bounds
    of the string, which could lead to reading beyond the allocated memory. This is
    dangerous because it can cause crashes or expose sensitive information. The fix
    involves checking the bounds before accessing the string. Always ensure bounds
    are validated before array or pointer access.
