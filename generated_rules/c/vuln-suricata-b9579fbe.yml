  message: 'The original code incorrectly handled the detection of content matches
    in Suricata, leading to potential false positives or negatives in rule matching.
    This could allow malicious traffic to bypass detection or cause legitimate traffic
    to be incorrectly flagged. The issue was fixed by properly handling the discontinue_matching
    flag and ensuring the correct conditions are checked before continuing or stopping
    the matching process. To fix this, ensure that the discontinue_matching flag is
    set appropriately and that the correct conditions are checked before proceeding
    with match or no-match decisions.
