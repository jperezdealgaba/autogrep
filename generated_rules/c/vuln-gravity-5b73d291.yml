  message: 'The code contains a potential null pointer dereference vulnerability.

    The original code executes multiple operations after a null check but before the
    goto statement, which can lead to undefined behavior if the null condition is
    true.

    The fix ensures that all operations are performed only if the pointer is not null,
    and the goto statement is executed only after all operations are complete.

    To fix this, ensure that all operations dependent on the pointer are enclosed
    within the null check block.
