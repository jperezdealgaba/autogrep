  message: 'The vulnerability involves the use of `assert` for input validation, which
    can be disabled in production builds, leading to potential undefined behavior.
    This is dangerous because it can result in security vulnerabilities if the input
    is not properly validated. Replace the `assert` with proper error handling using
    conditional checks and return statements.
