  message: 'Direct use of dialog tag as a hash key without verification can lead to
    hash table corruption. This vulnerability occurs when the dialog tag is used directly
    in the hash table operations, which can cause issues if the dialog is unregistered
    or modified. Instead, use a separate hash key (ht_key) that is managed and verified
    independently.
