  message: 'Detected a potential vulnerability in packet defragmentation logic. The
    original code would break the defragmentation process when encountering a fragment
    marked as the last one, which could lead to incomplete reassembly of packets.
    This is dangerous as it may result in incorrect packet processing or security
    bypass. The fix involves continuing the defragmentation process even if a fragment
    is marked as the last one, as subsequent fragments with the same offset might
    contain preferred data. Always verify the complete packet payload to ensure proper
    reassembly.
