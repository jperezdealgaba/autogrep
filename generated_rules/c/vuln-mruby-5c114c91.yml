  message: 'The vulnerability occurs when the garbage collector fails to properly
    mark and clear memory, leading to potential use-after-free or memory corruption
    issues. The original code conditionally marks or clears memory based on the type
    of the object, which can result in inconsistent memory states. The fix ensures
    that all memory is consistently marked and cleared. To fix this, ensure that all
    memory is properly marked and cleared in a consistent manner.
