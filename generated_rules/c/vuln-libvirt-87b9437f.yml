  message: 'The function `uploadVol` is called without checking its return value,
    which can lead to unhandled errors. This is dangerous because it may cause the
    program to continue execution with an undefined state, potentially leading to
    security vulnerabilities or crashes. To fix this, always check the return value
    of `uploadVol` and handle errors appropriately, for example by using a `goto`
    to a cleanup section.
