  message: 'The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to incorrect
    string length calculation.

    The original code subtracts 1 from the size of the buffer to account for null
    termination, but fails to consider the size of the pascal string length (sz).

    This can lead to buffer overflows when the string length is close to the buffer
    size.

    To fix this, ensure that the size of the pascal string length is subtracted from
    the buffer size when calculating the maximum length.
