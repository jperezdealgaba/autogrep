  message: 'The use of assert for input validation is dangerous because it can be
    disabled at compile time, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. In this
    case, the code fails to properly handle cases where the number of components is
    less than 3, which could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Replace the assert
    with proper error handling that includes a meaningful error message and a return
    value.
