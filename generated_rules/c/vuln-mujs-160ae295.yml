  message: 'The function `count` is called without a depth parameter, which can lead
    to a stack overflow due to uncontrolled recursion. This vulnerability occurs because
    the function does not track recursion depth, allowing it to exceed the `REG_MAXREC`
    limit. To fix this, ensure that the `count` function is always called with a depth
    parameter to prevent excessive recursion.
