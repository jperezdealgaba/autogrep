  message: 'The code prints a box type without proper context, which can lead to confusion
    in error handling and debugging. This could potentially mask important information
    or make it harder to diagnose issues. The fix adds the word "got" to provide better
    context. Always ensure error messages are clear and descriptive to aid in debugging
    and error handling.
