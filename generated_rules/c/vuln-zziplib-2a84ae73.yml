  message: 'The vulnerability involves an incorrect boundary check when verifying
    zip file trailers. The original code subtracts 2 from the size of the trailer
    structure, which could lead to buffer over-reads or incorrect validation of zip
    files. This could be exploited to process malformed zip files, potentially leading
    to crashes or security issues. The fix removes the incorrect subtraction, ensuring
    proper boundary checks.
