  message: "The vulnerability involves an incorrect bounds check that could lead to\
    \ memory corruption. \nThe original code checks if the data size is less than\
    \ or equal to the product of responder IDs and 2, \nwhich may not correctly account\
    \ for the actual data size. This could result in buffer overflows or \nother memory-related\
    \ issues. The fix involves a more accurate bounds check using the actual byte\
    \ count.\nEnsure that bounds checks accurately reflect the data size being processed.\n"
