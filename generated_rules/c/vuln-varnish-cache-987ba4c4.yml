  message: 'This code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient
    bounds checking in a loop condition. The condition `l * 8 < ae->mask` may allow
    `l` to exceed safe bounds, leading to undefined behavior or memory corruption.
    The fix adds a proper boundary check by subtracting 7 from `ae->mask` to ensure
    the loop stays within safe limits. To fix this, update the loop condition to include
    the boundary check as shown in the patched version.
