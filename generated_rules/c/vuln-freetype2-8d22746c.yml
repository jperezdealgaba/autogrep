  message: 'The code directly assigns `mask->end_point` to a variable without checking
    if it exceeds `glyph->num_points`. This can lead to out-of-bounds access when
    `mask->end_point` is greater than `glyph->num_points`, potentially causing memory
    corruption or crashes. To fix this, ensure that `mask->end_point` is clamped to
    `glyph->num_points` using a ternary operator.
