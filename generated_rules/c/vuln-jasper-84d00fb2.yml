  message: 'This rule detects potential integer overflow vulnerabilities in JPC_QCX_EXPN
    calculations. The original code performs an arithmetic operation without checking
    for overflow, which could lead to undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities.
    The fix introduces a bounds check to ensure the exponent value does not exceed
    0x20 before using it in the calculation. To fix this issue, always validate arithmetic
    operations that could result in overflow, especially when dealing with bitwise
    operations.
