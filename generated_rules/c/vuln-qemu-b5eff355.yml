  message: 'The use of BDRV_O_AUTOGROW flag in bdrv_file_open can lead to security
    vulnerabilities by allowing automatic growth of the block device without proper
    bounds checking. This can result in potential out-of-bounds access or resource
    exhaustion. The flag has been removed in the patch to mitigate these risks. Remove
    the BDRV_O_AUTOGROW flag from bdrv_file_open calls to ensure proper bounds checking
    and resource management.
