  message: 'The vulnerability occurs when the return value of `page_get_owner_and_reference`
    is ignored, which can lead to incorrect handling of page references. This can
    result in use-after-free or double-free vulnerabilities if the page is later accessed
    or freed without proper validation. To fix this, always check the return value
    of `page_get_owner_and_reference` and handle the page reference appropriately,
    especially when the owning domain is dying.
