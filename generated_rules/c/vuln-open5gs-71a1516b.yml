  message: 'The code uses a greater-than comparison (`>`) to check the version of
    the PFCP protocol, which is incorrect and can lead to security issues. The correct
    comparison should be an equality check (`!=`) to ensure compatibility with the
    exact version. This vulnerability can cause protocol mismatches and potential
    security vulnerabilities. Replace the `>` comparison with `!=`.
