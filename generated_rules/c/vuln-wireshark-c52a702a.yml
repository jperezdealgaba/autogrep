  message: 'The code checks for a specific status without considering the data type,
    which could lead to incorrect handling of certain error conditions. This can be
    dangerous as it might cause the application to miss critical error states or misclassify
    them. The fix involves adding a check for the data type using the `is_xerror`
    function. Always ensure that both the status and data type are considered when
    handling error conditions.
