  message: 'The code performs an incorrect size comparison by casting the length to
    `size_t`, which can lead to integer underflow and bypassing of the length check.
    This can result in processing packets that are too small, potentially leading
    to memory corruption or crashes. Always ensure length checks are performed with
    the correct type to avoid underflow issues.
