  message: 'The condition `if (len < (0xff - 7))` is incorrect and can lead to buffer
    overflow vulnerabilities. The check should be `if (len < 0xff)` to ensure that
    `len` does not exceed the maximum allowed value. This vulnerability can be exploited
    to cause undefined behavior or security issues. Always verify that the length
    of data does not exceed the intended bounds.
