  message: 'The vulnerability involves the direct assignment of a value from a credential
    structure in a single statement, which can lead to unsafe memory access or undefined
    behavior. This should be split into a declaration followed by an assignment to
    ensure safe initialization. Always separate declaration and assignment to avoid
    potential issues with memory access or uninitialized variables.
