  message: 'The code performs an inconsistent check between proposed and matched transform
    types, which could lead to security vulnerabilities in the IKEv2 protocol implementation.
    The original check only compared the proposed and matched states without ensuring
    that both ends of the communication agree on the presence of the transform. This
    could allow an attacker to exploit discrepancies in the protocol negotiation.
    The fix ensures that both local and remote ends agree on the presence and validity
    of the transform types, providing a more secure protocol implementation. Always
    ensure that both ends of the communication agree on the presence and validity
    of transform types in protocol negotiations.
