  message: 'The function `getupvalref` was called with an unnecessary `LClosure` pointer
    parameter, which could lead to undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities.
    This issue was fixed by removing the unused parameter. Ensure that `getupvalref`
    is called without the `LClosure` pointer parameter to avoid potential risks.
