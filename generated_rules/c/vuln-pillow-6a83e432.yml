  message: 'This rule detects a vulnerability where the bounds checking for image
    decoding in the PCX format is insufficient. The original code only checks the
    bounds for specific image modes ("1" and "P") separately, which can lead to buffer
    overflows if the image data exceeds the allocated buffer size. The fix consolidates
    the bounds check by considering the bit depth and ensuring the total size of the
    image data does not exceed the allocated buffer. This vulnerability could be exploited
    to cause a crash or potentially execute arbitrary code. To fix this, ensure that
    the bounds check accounts for the bit depth and the total size of the image data.
