  message: 'The code checks if the PIN length is zero and returns success if the PIN
    is already logged in, which can lead to bypassing PIN verification. This is dangerous
    as it may allow unauthorized access even when PIN caching is disabled. To fix
    this, ensure proper PIN verification is always enforced regardless of the logged-in
    state.
