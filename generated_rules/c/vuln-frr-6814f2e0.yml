  message: 'Detected unsafe handling of BGP attribute parsing. The code continues
    processing

    when it should treat certain cases as errors. This could allow processing of

    malformed BGP updates with missing mandatory attributes, potentially leading to

    security issues. The fix is to explicitly check for BGP_ATTR_PARSE_PROCEED and

    treat other cases as errors.
