  message: "The vulnerability involves improper handling of BIO objects in OpenSSL's\
    \ CMS implementation. \nThe original code directly assigns the output BIO to a\
    \ temporary BIO pointer without proper checks, \nwhich could lead to resource\
    \ leaks or incorrect behavior. The fix introduces a helper function \n`cms_get_text_bio`\
    \ to properly manage BIO objects. This issue could potentially be exploited to\
    \ \ncause memory leaks or other undefined behavior. Always use proper resource\
    \ management functions \nwhen handling BIO objects in OpenSSL.\n"
