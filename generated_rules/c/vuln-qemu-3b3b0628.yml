  message: 'The vulnerability involves improper handling of descriptor counts in the
    virtio implementation, which can lead to buffer overflows or incorrect memory
    access. The original code did not properly check the number of descriptors, potentially
    allowing too many descriptors to be processed. This can lead to memory corruption
    or crashes. The fix ensures that the number of descriptors is correctly validated
    before processing. Always ensure proper bounds checking when handling descriptor
    counts in virtio implementations.
