  message: "This rule detects potential integer overflow vulnerabilities in memory\
    \ allocation. \nThe vulnerable code directly adds 1 to the length `l` without\
    \ checking for overflow, \nwhich could lead to insufficient memory allocation\
    \ and potential security issues. \nThe fix uses `fxAddChunkSizes` to safely handle\
    \ the addition. Always use safe addition \nfunctions when calculating memory sizes\
    \ to prevent integer overflow.\n"
