  message: 'Setting a pointer to NULL without clearing the entire structure can lead
    to information disclosure vulnerabilities. The patch replaces the assignment with
    a memset to ensure all fields are properly initialized. This prevents potential
    exposure of sensitive data in uninitialized memory. Always use memset to clear
    structures completely.
