  message: 'The code fails to check if NbBits is zero before validating its upper
    bound, which could lead to undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities. This
    issue was fixed by adding a check for zero. Always validate both lower and upper
    bounds of input values to ensure they are within expected ranges.
