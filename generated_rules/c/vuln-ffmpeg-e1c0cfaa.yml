  message: 'The code assigns a value to `bppcount` without first validating if `bpp`
    exceeds a safe limit (64U in the fixed version). This could lead to integer overflow
    or other undefined behavior if `bpp` is too large. The fix includes a validation
    check for `bpp` before assigning `bppcount`, ensuring that the value is within
    a safe range. Always validate input values before using them in calculations or
    assignments to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
