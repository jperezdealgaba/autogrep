  message: 'This pattern detects a potential stack overflow vulnerability due to direct
    manipulation of the stack pointer without proper context. The original code uses
    a global `STACK` and `TOP` variable, which can lead to unsafe stack operations.
    The fix involves using a context-specific stack pointer (`J->stack` and `J->top`),
    which is safer and more maintainable. Ensure stack operations are performed within
    the correct context to prevent unintended behavior or security issues.
