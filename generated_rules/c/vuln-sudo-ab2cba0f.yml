  message: 'The function `getln` is being called without an error handling mechanism,
    which can lead to unhandled errors during password input. This can result in security
    issues such as unhandled timeouts or read errors. To fix this, ensure that `getln`
    is called with an additional `errval` parameter to handle errors appropriately.
