  message: 'The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to insufficient validation
    of the length field in an extension packet. The original code directly uses `ntohl(ep->vallen)`
    without proper bounds checking, which could allow an attacker to craft a malicious
    packet that exceeds the expected size, leading to memory corruption. The fix introduces
    a new function `exten_payload_size` to properly validate the payload size against
    the packet''s declared frame size. Always validate the length of incoming packets
    against expected bounds and use helper functions to ensure consistency.
