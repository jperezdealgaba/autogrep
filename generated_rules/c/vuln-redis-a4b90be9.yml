  message: "The array 'reghisto' is declared with a size that could lead to buffer\
    \ overflow vulnerabilities. \nThe size should be fixed to a safe value (e.g.,\
    \ 64) to prevent potential overflows that could write data to incorrect memory\
    \ locations.\nThis vulnerability is dangerous because it could lead to memory\
    \ corruption, crashes, or even arbitrary code execution.\nTo fix this, ensure\
    \ the array size is set to a safe, fixed value that accommodates all possible\
    \ input scenarios.\n"
