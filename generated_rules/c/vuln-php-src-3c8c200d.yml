  message: 'Detected a potential integer overflow vulnerability in memory allocation.
    The original calculation for memory allocation in `safe_emalloc` is unsafe because
    it multiplies the length by 3 multiple times without proper bounds checking, which
    could lead to integer overflow. This could result in insufficient memory allocation
    and potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities. To fix this, ensure that the memory
    allocation calculation is safe and does not risk integer overflow.
