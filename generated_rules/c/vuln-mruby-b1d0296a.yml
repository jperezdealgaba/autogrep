  message: 'The vulnerability involves a missing cleanup operation after deleting
    a method table entry. This can lead to memory corruption or undefined behavior
    due to stale references. The fix adds a call to `mrb_mc_clear_by_class` to properly
    clean up the class cache. Ensure that all cleanup operations are performed before
    returning from the function.
