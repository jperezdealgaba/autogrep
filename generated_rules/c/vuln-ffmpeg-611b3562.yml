  message: 'Detected a potential vulnerability where a negative value is directly
    returned from a function call without proper handling. This can lead to incorrect
    error handling and potential security issues. The fix involves assigning the result
    to a local variable first and properly handling the error condition before assigning
    it to the structure field.
