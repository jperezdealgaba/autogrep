  message: 'Detected a potential out-of-bounds access vulnerability due to incorrect
    counter increment logic.

    The counter is incremented before checking the bounds, which could lead to accessing
    memory beyond the allocated size.

    To fix this, check the bounds before incrementing the counter and handle the condition
    appropriately.
