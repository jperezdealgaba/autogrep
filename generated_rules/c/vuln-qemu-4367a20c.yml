  message: 'Detected a potential use-after-free vulnerability due to incorrect nullification
    of a pointer.

    This pattern matches the unsafe practice of only nullifying a pointer''s member
    instead of the pointer itself,

    which can lead to use-after-free conditions. To fix this, ensure the entire pointer
    is set to NULL.
