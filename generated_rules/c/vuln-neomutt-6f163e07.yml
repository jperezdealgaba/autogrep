  message: 'The function `mutt_b64_decode` is being called without specifying the
    output buffer size, which can lead to buffer overflows. This is dangerous because
    it can result in memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to execute
    arbitrary code or crash the application. Always pass the size of the output buffer
    as the third argument to `mutt_b64_decode` to prevent buffer overflows.
