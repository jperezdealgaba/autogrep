  message: 'This pattern detects a potential vulnerability where the code increments
    the pointer without checking if it points to a valid character. This could lead
    to out-of-bounds memory access, which is dangerous as it can cause crashes, data
    corruption, or even arbitrary code execution. To fix this, ensure that the pointer
    is only incremented if it points to a valid character.
