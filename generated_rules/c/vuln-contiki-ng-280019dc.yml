  message: 'Detected a potential integer overflow vulnerability in buffer size calculation.

    The original code adds the current index and payload length before comparing to
    the MTU,

    which could lead to an overflow and bypass the size check.

    To fix, subtract the current index from the MTU before comparing with the payload
    length.
