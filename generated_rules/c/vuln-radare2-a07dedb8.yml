  message: 'Unsafe use of ut64 for page_size without validation can lead to integer
    overflow or unexpected behavior.

    This vulnerability occurs because the page_size variable is declared as ut64 (unsigned
    64-bit integer) without checking for valid values.

    An attacker could potentially exploit this by providing a maliciously crafted
    binary with a page_size of 0 or a very large value.

    The fix involves changing the type to int and adding a validation check to ensure
    page_size is at least 1, defaulting to 4096 if invalid.
