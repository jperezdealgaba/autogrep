  message: 'This rule detects insecure memory handling in NTP''s authkeys.c where
    a buffer is allocated without properly clearing or freeing the existing secret.
    This can lead to sensitive information leakage or use-after-free vulnerabilities.
    Always ensure that existing buffers are properly cleared and freed before reallocating
    them.
