  message: 'The code uses `info()` instead of `fatal()` to handle failure in assuming
    a user ID, which can lead to continued execution with incorrect privileges. This
    is dangerous because it may allow unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
    Replace `info()` with `fatal()` to ensure the program terminates when it cannot
    assume the specified user ID.
