  message: 'The code generates an MCS (Multi-Category Security) label without considering
    the subset relationship between categories. This can lead to improper access control
    as a process can access a file if the set of MCS categories for the file is equal
    to or a subset of the set of MCS categories for the process. The fix is to discard
    cases where the categories are equal, as they are subsets of other category pairs.
