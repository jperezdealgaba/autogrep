  message: 'The direct casting and assignment of a pointer in a single statement can
    lead to potential type confusion or incorrect assumptions about the object''s
    type. This can be dangerous as it may result in undefined behavior or security
    vulnerabilities if the object is not of the expected type. Instead, declare the
    pointer first and then perform the casting and assignment in separate steps to
    ensure clarity and safety.
