  message: 'Detected a potential integer overflow vulnerability in bit rate calculation.

    The code performs arithmetic operations without proper bounds checking, which
    could lead to integer overflows.

    To fix this, add bounds checking before performing arithmetic operations and handle
    overflow cases appropriately.
