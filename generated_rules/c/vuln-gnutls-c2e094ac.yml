  message: 'This rule detects a timing side-channel vulnerability in the GnuTLS library.
    The original implementation of the `dummy_wait` function did not properly account
    for timing variations during MAC verification, which could allow an attacker to
    infer information about the MAC or padding. The vulnerability was fixed by modifying
    the function to ensure consistent timing behavior. To fix this issue, ensure that
    timing variations are minimized during cryptographic operations, especially during
    MAC verification and padding checks.
