  message: 'Incomplete bounds check in e1000e network device emulation. The code only
    checks if two MAC addresses are equal but fails to verify if the destination address
    is within valid bounds. This could lead to out-of-bounds memory access. The fix
    adds an additional check to ensure the destination address is within the allowed
    range.
