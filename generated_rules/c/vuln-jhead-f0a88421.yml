  message: 'The function `process_EXIF` previously returned `void`, which could lead
    to undefined behavior when handling malformed EXIF sections. This could potentially
    cause memory leaks or other undefined behavior. The function should return an
    integer to indicate success or failure, and the caller should handle the return
    value appropriately.
