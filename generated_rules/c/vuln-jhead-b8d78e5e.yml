  message: 'The memmove operation is missing a -1 in the size calculation, which could
    lead to an off-by-one error and potential memory corruption. This is dangerous
    as it can cause undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. To fix
    it, ensure the size calculation includes the -1 to correctly account for the elements
    being moved.
