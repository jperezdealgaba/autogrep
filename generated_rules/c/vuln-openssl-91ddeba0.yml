  message: 'The code fails to properly validate the DH parameter ''q'' against ''p'',
    which can lead to security vulnerabilities in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
    Specifically, it doesn''t check if ''p'' is greater than ''q'' before using them,
    which is a critical validation step. This could allow an attacker to exploit invalid
    parameter values. To fix this, ensure that ''q'' is not NULL and that ''p'' is
    greater than ''q'' before proceeding with the key exchange.
