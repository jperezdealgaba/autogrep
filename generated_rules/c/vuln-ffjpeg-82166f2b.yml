  message: 'The code directly assigns a value from a buffer to `comp_num` without
    bounds checking, which can lead to out-of-bounds access or memory corruption.
    This is dangerous because it can be exploited to cause undefined behavior or security
    vulnerabilities. To fix this, ensure the value is within the expected range before
    assignment.
