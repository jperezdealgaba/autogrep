  message: 'The code performs a division operation without checking if the denominator
    is zero, which can lead to a division-by-zero vulnerability. This can cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. To fix this, ensure the denominator is checked before performing
    the division, or use the R2D macro which includes this check.
