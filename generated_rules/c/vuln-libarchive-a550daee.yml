  message: 'The code increments the array index before checking the bounds, which
    can lead to an out-of-bounds write. This is dangerous because it can result in
    memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes, data corruption, or even remote
    code execution. To fix this, ensure the bounds check is performed before incrementing
    the array index.
