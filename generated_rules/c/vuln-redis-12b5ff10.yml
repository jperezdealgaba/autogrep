  message: 'The array `reghisto` was originally declared with a size of `HLL_Q+2`,
    which could lead to buffer overflows if the input exceeds this size. This vulnerability
    can result in memory corruption and potential security exploits. To fix this,
    the array should be declared with a safe size, such as 64, to handle all possible
    inputs without overflow.
