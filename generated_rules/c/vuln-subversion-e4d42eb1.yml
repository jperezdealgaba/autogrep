  message: "Detected a potential resource leak due to improper pool management. \n\
    The code uses the parent pool (`$RESOURCE->pool`) directly for property operations,\
    \ which can lead to resource exhaustion in scenarios with multiple calls. \nThis\
    \ vulnerability can cause memory leaks or degraded performance. \nTo fix, create\
    \ and use a subpool (`svn_pool_create`) for these operations and destroy it (`svn_pool_destroy`)\
    \ after use.\n"
