  message: 'The assignment `*getnext = TRUE;` is unsafe as it unconditionally sets
    the value without checking the input. This could lead to unintended behavior or
    security vulnerabilities. The fix checks if `*p` is not a newline character before
    setting `*getnext`, ensuring safer operation.
