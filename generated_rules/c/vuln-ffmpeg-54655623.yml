  message: 'The code fails to properly check for the first slice in a frame, which
    can lead to state corruption. This vulnerability occurs when two slices incorrectly
    report being the first in the same frame, causing the decoder to enter an inconsistent
    state. The fix adds an additional check for `first_slice_in_pic_flag` and returns
    an error code instead of jumping to a fail label, preventing state corruption.
