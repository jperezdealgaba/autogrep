  message: 'Detected a potential NULL pointer dereference vulnerability. The code
    checks only the second element of the split array for NULL, but does not verify
    the array itself or the first element. This can lead to a crash or undefined behavior
    if either the array or the first element is NULL. To fix this, ensure you check
    the array and all relevant elements for NULL before accessing them.
