  message: 'This rule detects a potential vulnerability where a dynamic payload is
    freed based on an equality comparison.

    This can lead to memory corruption or use-after-free vulnerabilities if the payload
    is incorrectly freed.

    The fix involves commenting out the problematic code to prevent unsafe memory
    operations.
