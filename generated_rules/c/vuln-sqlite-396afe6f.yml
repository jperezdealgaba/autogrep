  message: 'The condition in the SQLite query is missing a check for the SF_Distinct
    flag, which could lead to incorrect query results or security vulnerabilities.
    This patch adds a check to ensure that the outer query is not DISTINCT, preventing
    potential issues with query execution. To fix this, ensure that all necessary
    conditions are included in the if statement, particularly the check for the SF_Distinct
    flag.
