  message: 'Detected a potential buffer underflow vulnerability due to insufficient
    size validation.

    The code breaks without proper error handling when the buffer size is too small,

    which could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate buffer sizes

    and handle errors appropriately by returning an error flow and cleaning up resources.
