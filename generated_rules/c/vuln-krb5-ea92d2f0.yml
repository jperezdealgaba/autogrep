  message: 'Detected an integer overflow vulnerability in buffer boundary checks.

    The original check could allow for integer overflow when calculating the buffer
    size,

    potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory access. The fix ensures that the buffer

    offset and size are properly validated to prevent overflow conditions.

    To fix this, ensure that the buffer offset and size are checked separately and
    that

    the size does not exceed the remaining space after the offset.
