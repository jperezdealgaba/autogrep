  message: 'The code is vulnerable to a boundary check issue where it fails to validate
    the ''y'' coordinate against the image height. This can lead to out-of-bounds
    memory access, potentially causing crashes or security vulnerabilities. The fix
    adds a check for ''y >= height'' and properly handles the case when ''y >= orig_height''
    by jumping to the ''end'' label. To fix this, ensure all boundary conditions are
    properly validated before accessing memory.
