  message: 'The code fails to handle the case where `cl` is NULL, which can lead to
    a NULL pointer dereference. This vulnerability can cause the application to crash
    or be exploited for denial of service. Ensure that all pointer checks are properly
    handled and consider adding additional error handling or logging for NULL cases.
