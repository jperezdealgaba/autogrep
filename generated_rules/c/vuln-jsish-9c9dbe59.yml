  message: 'Detected a potential vulnerability where the array size is not properly
    incremented before assignment, which could lead to out-of-bounds access. Additionally,
    the reference count for the assigned value is not incremented, which could lead
    to use-after-free or memory corruption issues. To fix this, ensure the array size
    is incremented by 1 and increment the reference count of the value being assigned.
