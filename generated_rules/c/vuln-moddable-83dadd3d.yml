  message: 'The code uses a fixed stack margin of 32 KB, which may not be sufficient
    for certain environments and could lead to stack overflow vulnerabilities. This
    was fixed by reducing the base margin to 16 KB and adding a configurable mxASANStackMargin
    to adjust for different environments. To fix this, ensure the stack margin is
    configurable and appropriate for the target environment.
