  message: 'The condition ''listenerCount(''select-bluetooth-device'') === 0'' can
    lead to security vulnerabilities by not properly handling Bluetooth device selection
    events. This can allow unauthorized devices to connect. Fix by checking if the
    listener count is exactly 1 instead of 0.
