  message: 'The code allows redirects based on a negative check for HTTP and HTTPS
    protocols, which can lead to unsafe redirects to untrusted protocols. This can
    be exploited to redirect users to malicious sites or applications. To fix this,
    use a whitelist of trusted protocols and check if the protocol is included in
    that list.
