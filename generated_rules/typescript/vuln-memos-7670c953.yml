  message: 'The code uses the `marked` function without including `PlainText` in the
    list of parsers, which can lead to improper handling of plain text content. This
    can result in security vulnerabilities such as XSS if the plain text is not properly
    sanitized. To fix this, ensure `PlainText` is included in the parsers list when
    using the `marked` function.
