  message: 'Detected an authentication bypass vulnerability where provider validation
    is performed after status validation, allowing potential bypass of provider checks.
    This can lead to unauthorized access if a user''s status is ''active'' but their
    provider is invalid. Combine both status and provider checks in a single condition
    to prevent this vulnerability.
