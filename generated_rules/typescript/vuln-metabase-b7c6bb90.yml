  message: 'Detected a potentially unsafe conditional check that only verifies if
    a question can run without ensuring it is either saved or structured.

    This vulnerability could allow unauthorized or unsafe queries to be executed.

    To fix this, ensure the condition also checks if the question is saved or structured
    using `question.isSaved()` or `question.isStructured()`.
