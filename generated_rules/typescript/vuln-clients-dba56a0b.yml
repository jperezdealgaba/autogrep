  message: 'Using `window.location.reload(true)` for a hard reload is dangerous in
    Electron applications as it doesn''t properly clear memory or handle process cleanup.
    This can lead to memory leaks and inconsistent application state. Instead, use
    Electron''s IPC mechanism to trigger a controlled process reload that properly
    cleans up resources and ensures memory is garbage collected.
