  message: 'The code fails to check if a call event is redacted, which can lead to
    incorrect handling of terminated calls. This vulnerability could allow redacted
    calls to be processed as if they were valid, potentially leading to security issues.
    To fix this, ensure that the `isRedacted()` method is called alongside checking
    for terminated content.
