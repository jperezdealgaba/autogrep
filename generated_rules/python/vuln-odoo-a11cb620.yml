  message: 'Detected missing access rights check after creating a record. This can
    lead to unauthorized access or modification of sensitive data. The vulnerability
    occurs when `super().create()` is called without subsequently verifying the user''s
    access rights. The fix involves calling `_check_rights()` after record creation
    to ensure proper access control.
