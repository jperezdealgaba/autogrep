  message: 'Detected potentially vulnerable regex pattern matching that could lead
    to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service). The original implementation uses
    a single regex match that could be exploited with carefully crafted input. The
    fix separates the word matching from the punctuation matching and processes matches
    in reverse order to avoid overlapping matches. To fix this, use the _match_potential_end_contexts
    method instead of direct regex matching.
