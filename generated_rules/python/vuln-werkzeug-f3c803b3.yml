  message: 'Detected a potential security issue in boundary checking logic. The original
    code directly concatenates the boundary string, which can lead to incorrect boundary
    detection. This vulnerability could allow for improper parsing of multipart data,
    potentially leading to security issues. The fix involves storing the boundary
    in a variable before checking its presence in the buffer.
