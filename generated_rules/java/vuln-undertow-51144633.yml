  message: 'Insecure logging of HTTP exchange detected. The original implementation
    logs only the request method and URI, potentially omitting critical security information.
    This can lead to incomplete audit trails and difficulty in diagnosing security
    incidents. The fix includes logging request and response headers to provide a
    more comprehensive audit trail. Ensure that all relevant security-related information
    is included in logs.
