  message: 'Detected insecure cleanup of action names in Struts. The original code
    attempts to clean up action names by removing disallowed patterns, which can lead
    to security vulnerabilities. Instead, it should throw an exception when an action
    name does not match the allowed pattern. This prevents potential exploitation
    of unsafe action names.

    To fix this, ensure that invalid action names are rejected immediately by throwing
    a StrutsException.
