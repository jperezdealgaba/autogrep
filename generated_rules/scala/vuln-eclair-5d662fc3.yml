  message: 'The PublishAsap case class is missing a strategy parameter, which is required

    to properly handle transaction publishing with appropriate feerate management.

    Without this, transactions may be published with suboptimal fees, leading to

    delays or failures in confirmation. The fix adds a PublishStrategy parameter

    to control the feerate and other publishing behavior. Always include a proper

    publishing strategy when creating transactions.
