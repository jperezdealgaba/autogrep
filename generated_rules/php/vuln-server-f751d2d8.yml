  message: 'The original code directly calls `getRemoteAddress()` multiple times,
    which can lead to inconsistent IP address handling and potential security issues.
    The fix consolidates the IP address retrieval into a single variable and uses
    it consistently throughout the login failure handling. This ensures consistent
    IP address handling and prevents potential race conditions. To fix this, store
    the result of `getRemoteAddress()` in a variable and use that variable consistently.
