  message: 'Detected use of reference assignment to `$GLOBALS` which can lead to unintended
    modifications of global state. This can be dangerous as it allows for potential
    security vulnerabilities by exposing sensitive data or allowing unauthorized modifications.
    Replace the reference assignment with a direct assignment and ensure sensitive
    data is unset when no longer needed.
