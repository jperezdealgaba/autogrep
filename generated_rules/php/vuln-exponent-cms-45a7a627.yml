  message: 'The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization
    of the ''order'' parameter. The use of preg_replace with a limited character set
    does not fully prevent malicious input from being included in SQL queries. This
    can allow attackers to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to data
    leakage or unauthorized access. To fix this, use a proper escaping function like
    expString::escape to ensure the input is safely sanitized.
