  message: 'The code lacks CSRF token validation for the ''clear-visits'' action,
    making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks. An attacker could trick a user into performing
    unauthorized actions. To fix this, ensure that the action is only executed if
    a valid CSRF token is present in both POST and GET requests.
