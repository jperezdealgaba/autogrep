  message: 'The use of $_REQUEST[''sql_query''] is insecure because $_REQUEST combines
    data from $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE, which can lead to unexpected or malicious
    input. This can result in SQL injection or other security vulnerabilities. Always
    use $_POST[''sql_query''] to ensure the data comes from a POST request, which
    is typically more secure.
