  message: 'The code directly trims and uses user input without proper sanitization,
    which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This is dangerous
    because it allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the application.
    To fix this, ensure that user input is sanitized using `xss_clean` before processing.
