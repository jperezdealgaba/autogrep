  message: "Detected potential command injection vulnerability due to missing input\
    \ sanitization. \nThe code constructs a shell command by directly concatenating\
    \ user-controlled input, which can lead to arbitrary command execution. \nTo fix\
    \ this, use `escapeshellcmd` to sanitize the command string before execution.\n"
