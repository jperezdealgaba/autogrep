  message: 'The CSRF check is conditionally deferred based on the `$GLOBALS[''csrf''][''defer'']`
    setting, which can lead to security bypass if the setting is improperly configured.
    This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass CSRF protection by manipulating
    the global defer setting. Ensure that CSRF checks are always enforced without
    relying on conditional deferral.
