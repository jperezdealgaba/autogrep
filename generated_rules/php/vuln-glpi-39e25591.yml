  message: 'Direct assignment of an array with ''OR'' condition to `$search_where`
    without considering visibility restrictions can lead to security vulnerabilities.
    This can expose sensitive data by bypassing access controls. To fix this, ensure
    that visibility criteria are applied before adding the ''OR'' condition.
