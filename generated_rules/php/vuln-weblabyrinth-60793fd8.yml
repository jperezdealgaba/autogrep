  message: 'Detected a SQL injection vulnerability due to unescaped user input in
    a database query. This can allow attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands,
    potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access. To fix this, use
    proper escaping functions like `sqlite_escape_string()` on user inputs before
    including them in SQL queries.
