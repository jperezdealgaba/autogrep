  message: 'The function `testPasswordLength` does not enforce a maximum password
    length, which can lead to security vulnerabilities when using hashing algorithms
    like BCRYPT that truncate passwords beyond 72 characters. This can give the false
    impression that the entire password is being used for authentication when it is
    not. The vulnerability was fixed by splitting the function into `testMinimumPasswordLength`
    and `testMaximumPasswordLength` to properly enforce both constraints.
