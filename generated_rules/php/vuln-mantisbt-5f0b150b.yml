  message: 'The code is vulnerable due to missing project context in `config_get`
    calls, which could lead to incorrect access control decisions. This is dangerous
    because it may allow unauthorized users to download attachments. To fix this,
    ensure that `config_get` includes the project context by passing the project ID
    obtained via `bug_get_field`.
