  message: 'The pattern replacement for ''page:'' CSS property is vulnerable to XSS
    attacks as it does not properly handle the ''page:'' property, potentially allowing
    injection of malicious content. The fix replaces the ''page:'' property with ''unset''
    to prevent XSS. Always ensure that CSS properties are properly sanitized to prevent
    injection attacks.
