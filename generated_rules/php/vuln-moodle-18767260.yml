  message: 'Directly using `print_r()` without proper memory handling can lead to
    memory exhaustion when handling large objects. This vulnerability can cause the
    application to crash or become unresponsive. The fix involves raising the memory
    limit and ensuring the output is properly sanitized using `s()` before being echoed.
