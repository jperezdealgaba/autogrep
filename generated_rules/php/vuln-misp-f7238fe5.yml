  message: 'The use of `referer()` without specifying the action and model ID can
    lead to security vulnerabilities such as open redirects or improper access control.
    This can allow attackers to manipulate the referer URL, potentially leading to
    phishing attacks or unauthorized access. To fix this, always specify the action
    and model ID when setting the referer, ensuring that the URL is properly controlled
    and validated.
