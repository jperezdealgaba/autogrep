  message: 'The use of `$_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]` for file path generation is vulnerable
    to XSS attacks as it can be manipulated by user input. This can lead to malicious
    script execution in the browser. Use `$_SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"]` instead, which
    is not affected by user input and provides a more secure way to generate file
    paths.
