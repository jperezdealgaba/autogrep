  message: 'The vulnerability involves improperly setting the context in repository
    instances, which could lead to unauthorized access or incorrect permissions. The
    original code included the system context alongside the current context, potentially
    bypassing intended access controls. The fix removes the system context, ensuring
    proper permission checks. To fix this, ensure that the context is set correctly
    without including unnecessary system contexts.
