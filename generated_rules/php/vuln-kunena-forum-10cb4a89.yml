  message: 'The code is vulnerable due to the lack of file extension validation when
    handling avatar uploads. This can allow attackers to upload malicious files with
    arbitrary extensions, potentially leading to remote code execution or other security
    issues. The vulnerability was fixed by moving the file extension validation logic
    into the upload class and explicitly checking for allowed extensions (gif, jpeg,
    jpg, png). To fix this, ensure that file extensions are validated before processing
    uploads.
