  message: 'Detected potential XSS vulnerability due to unvalidated user input being
    assigned to a message field. This can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts
    into the application, leading to security breaches. To fix this, ensure that user
    input is sanitized using a function like `xss_clean()` before being assigned to
    the message field.
