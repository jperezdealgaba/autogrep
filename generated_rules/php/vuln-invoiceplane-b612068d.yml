  message: 'The code is vulnerable to brute force attacks due to missing login attempt
    tracking and account lockout mechanisms. Without these protections, attackers
    can repeatedly attempt to guess passwords, increasing the risk of unauthorized
    access. Implement a login attempt tracking system that locks accounts after a
    certain number of failed attempts and resets the counter after a successful login
    or a specified time period.
