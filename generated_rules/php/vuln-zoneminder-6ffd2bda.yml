  message: 'The use of `ZM\Warning` for logging security-related events can lead to
    insufficient logging of critical security events. This can make it difficult to
    detect and respond to potential security incidents. Replace `ZM\Warning` with
    `ZM\Debug` or a more appropriate logging level to ensure proper logging of security
    events.
