  message: 'The unenrol_user function is called with unnecessary arguments, which
    can lead to incorrect user unenrollment. This is dangerous because it might cause
    unintended side effects or security issues by passing invalid or unexpected parameters.
    The fix is to remove the unnecessary arguments and only pass the required ones.
