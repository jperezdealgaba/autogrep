  message: 'The regular expression used in `preg_replace_callback` is too restrictive
    and does not handle all possible hexadecimal escape sequences, which could lead
    to incomplete sanitization of CSS styles and potential XSS vulnerabilities. The
    pattern should be updated to allow for longer hexadecimal sequences (2-6 characters)
    and to handle non-hexadecimal escape characters properly.
