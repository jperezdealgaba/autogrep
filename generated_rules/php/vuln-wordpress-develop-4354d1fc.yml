  message: 'This rule detects a vulnerability where changing a user''s email does
    not invalidate their password reset key. This can allow an attacker to maintain
    access to an account even after the email has been changed. To fix this, ensure
    that both email and password changes invalidate the password reset key by adding
    a check for `$user_pass !== $old_user_data->user_pass` in the condition.
