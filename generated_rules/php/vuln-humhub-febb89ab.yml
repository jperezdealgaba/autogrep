  message: 'The order of xssClean and stripTags functions is incorrect, which may
    lead to XSS vulnerabilities. The stripTags function should be applied after xssClean
    to ensure proper sanitization. This is dangerous because it can allow malicious
    HTML to bypass the sanitization process. To fix this, reverse the order of the
    functions to ensure proper sanitization.
