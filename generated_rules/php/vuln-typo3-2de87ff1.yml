  message: 'The code checks if a storage''s UID is 0 to determine if it is a fallback
    storage. This is insecure because it relies on an internal implementation detail
    that could change. Instead, use the `isFallbackStorage()` method, which is the
    intended and secure way to check for fallback storage. This vulnerability could
    lead to incorrect permissions being applied or files being accessed when they
    shouldn''t be.
