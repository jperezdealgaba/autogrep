  message: 'This vulnerability occurs when unsafe HTML and JavaScript content is not
    properly filtered, potentially leading to XSS attacks. The patch adds ''js'' to
    the list of unset keys to ensure that JavaScript content is also filtered when
    $unfiltered is empty. To fix this, make sure to unset both ''htm|html'' and ''js''
    keys in the $t array when $unfiltered is empty.
