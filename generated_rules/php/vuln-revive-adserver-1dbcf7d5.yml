  message: 'The code is vulnerable due to insufficient escaping in the `addcslashes`
    function. The original pattern does not escape the forward slash (`/`), which
    can lead to security issues such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) when the output
    is used in JavaScript contexts. The fix includes escaping the forward slash to
    prevent such vulnerabilities. To fix this, ensure all necessary characters, including
    the forward slash, are properly escaped.
