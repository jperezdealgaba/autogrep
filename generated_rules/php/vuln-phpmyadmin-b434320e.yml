  message: 'The code directly uses a file path from a global array without proper
    sanitization, which can lead to path traversal or file inclusion vulnerabilities.
    This is dangerous because an attacker could manipulate the path to include malicious
    files. To fix this, use PMA_securePath() to sanitize the file path.
