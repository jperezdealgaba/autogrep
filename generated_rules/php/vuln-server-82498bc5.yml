  message: 'The code casts the result of a ternary operation to an integer, which
    can lead to incorrect handling of infinite values. This is dangerous because it
    can cause unexpected behavior when dealing with large or infinite values, potentially
    leading to security issues or incorrect calculations. The fix removes the unnecessary
    cast to ensure proper handling of INF and PHP_INT_MAX.
