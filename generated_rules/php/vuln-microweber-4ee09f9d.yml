  message: 'The assignment of `intval($parent_id)` to `$categories_id` without also
    assigning it to `$parent_id` can lead to inconsistent state. This can cause unexpected
    behavior in the application, especially if `$parent_id` is used later without
    being sanitized. To fix this, ensure both variables are assigned the sanitized
    value.
