  message: 'Detected a command injection vulnerability due to the use of unsanitized
    user input in a system command.

    This is dangerous as it allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the
    server.

    To fix this, always sanitize user input using `escapeshellarg` and `escapeshellcmd`
    before passing it to system commands.
