  message: 'The code checks if a user is registered without considering whether the
    user is hidden and whether the current user has permission to view hidden users.
    This can lead to security issues where hidden users are treated as unregistered
    even if they should be accessible to certain users. To fix this, ensure that the
    check includes a verification for hidden users and the current user''s permissions.
