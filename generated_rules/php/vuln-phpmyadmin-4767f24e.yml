  message: 'Direct iteration over $_GET[''scripts''] without limiting the number of
    elements can lead to resource exhaustion or denial of service attacks. An attacker
    could send a large number of script requests, causing the server to process an
    excessive amount of data. To fix this, use array_slice to limit the number of
    processed elements, as shown in the fixed version.
