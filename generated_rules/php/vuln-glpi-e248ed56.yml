  message: 'Direct comparison of `self::$output_type` with `self::HTML_OUTPUT` can
    lead to inconsistent behavior and potential security issues. The output type should
    be checked once and stored in a variable for consistent use throughout the code.
    This ensures that all subsequent checks are consistent and reduces the risk of
    logic errors.

    To fix this, store the result of the comparison in a variable and use that variable
    for all subsequent checks.
