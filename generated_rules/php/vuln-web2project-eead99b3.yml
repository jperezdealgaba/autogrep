  message: 'The regular expression used in `preg_replace` does not properly sanitize
    input by excluding backticks (`) and parentheses. This can lead to potential code
    injection vulnerabilities. The fix includes adding backticks and parentheses to
    the list of characters to be removed. Ensure all dangerous characters are properly
    sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
