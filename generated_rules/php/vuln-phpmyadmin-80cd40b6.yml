  message: 'The code directly uses user input to construct a file path without proper
    validation, which can lead to path traversal or arbitrary file inclusion vulnerabilities.
    This is dangerous because an attacker could manipulate the input to load unintended
    files, potentially leading to remote code execution. To fix this, validate the
    input against a whitelist of allowed values before using it in file operations.
