  message: 'The use of `escapeshellcmd` is insecure for command injection prevention
    as it does not properly escape arguments. Use `escapeshellarg` instead to ensure
    that arguments are safely quoted.

    This vulnerability can lead to command injection attacks if the input is not properly
    sanitized.

    To fix this, replace `escapeshellcmd` with `escapeshellarg`.
