  message: 'The code directly uses user input as a filename without sanitization,
    which can lead to path traversal or file inclusion vulnerabilities. This is dangerous
    because an attacker can manipulate the filename to access or upload files outside
    the intended directory. To fix this, always sanitize user input using functions
    like `basename()` and validate the file type before processing.
