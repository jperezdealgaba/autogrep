  message: "The code contains a logic flaw in file extension validation, which could\
    \ allow bypassing security checks. \nThe original code returns `true` when the\
    \ extension is in the allowed list, but does not explicitly handle the case when\
    \ it is not, potentially leading to security bypass. \nThe fix ensures that the\
    \ function returns `false` when the extension is not in the allowed list, properly\
    \ enforcing the security check.\n"
