  message: 'The use of `unserialize` on user-controlled input can lead to PHP object
    injection vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code. This
    is particularly dangerous when dealing with form data. The fix replaces `unserialize`
    with `json_decode`, which is safer as it does not allow for object instantiation.
    Always use `json_decode` or other safe deserialization methods when handling user
    input.
