  message: 'The use of a regular expression in preg_split that does not account for
    all variations of colon characters can lead to security vulnerabilities. Specifically,
    the pattern does not handle the HTML entity ''&colon;'', which could be exploited
    to bypass input sanitization. This can result in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or
    other injection attacks. To fix this, ensure that all possible representations
    of colons are included in the regular expression pattern.
