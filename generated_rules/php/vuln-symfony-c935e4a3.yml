  message: 'Multiple attributes in access control checks are being evaluated incorrectly,
    potentially leading to security bypasses. The original code evaluates attributes
    in a loop with an OR condition, which could allow access if any single attribute
    is granted. The fixed version evaluates all attributes together with an AND condition.
    To fix this, pass the attributes array directly to the `decide` method with the
    `allowMultipleAttributes` parameter set to true.
