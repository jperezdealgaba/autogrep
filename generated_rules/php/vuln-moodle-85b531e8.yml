  message: 'The code contains a logic flaw in the capability check for user reports.
    The original code first checks for the ''moodle/user:viewuseractivitiesreport''
    capability and then checks if the user is the current user, which can lead to
    incorrect access control. The fixed version correctly prioritizes checking if
    the user is the current user first, and then checks for the capability. This ensures
    proper access control and prevents unauthorized access to user reports.
