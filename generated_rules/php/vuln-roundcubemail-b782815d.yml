  message: 'The vulnerability involves directly using unescaped user input in an array,
    which can lead to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks. This is dangerous because
    it allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the application. To fix this,
    always use the rcube::Q() function to properly escape the input.
