  message: 'The use of `$source` directly in `get_moodle_file` is unsafe as it can
    lead to security vulnerabilities. The `$source` parameter is not cleaned and can
    be manipulated by an attacker. Instead, use `$reference`, which is obtained from
    `get_file_reference($source)` to ensure the file reference is properly validated.
