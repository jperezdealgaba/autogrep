  message: 'The code directly iterates over an array containing both `iaAcl::OBJECT_PAGE`
    and `iaAcl::OBJECT_ADMIN_PAGE` without proper access control checks. This can
    lead to unauthorized access to admin pages. The fix involves conditionally adding
    `iaAcl::OBJECT_ADMIN_PAGE` to the array based on the user''s group membership.
    Always validate user permissions before granting access to sensitive resources.
