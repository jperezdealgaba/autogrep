  message: 'Detected potential CSV injection vulnerability. Directly using str_replace
    to escape quotes in CSV output is insufficient as it doesn''t handle formula injection
    via characters like =, +, -, or @ at the start of cell values. This can lead to
    CSV injection attacks where malicious formulas are executed when the CSV is opened
    in spreadsheet software. Use the ttNeutralizeForCsv function instead, which properly
    sanitizes the input by removing dangerous characters from the start and escaping
    quotes.
