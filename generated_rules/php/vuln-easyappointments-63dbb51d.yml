  message: 'The code directly uses the result of a login check without verifying the
    user''s role, which can lead to unauthorized access. This is dangerous because
    it bypasses role-based access control, potentially allowing non-admin users to
    perform admin operations. To fix this, ensure that the user''s role is verified
    after a successful login.
