  message: 'Detected an insecure redirect that could allow open redirect attacks.

    The vulnerability occurs when user-controlled input is used directly in a redirect
    without proper validation.

    This can be exploited by attackers to redirect users to malicious websites.

    To fix this, ensure redirects are validated and sanitized, and use absolute URLs
    with proper domain constraints.
