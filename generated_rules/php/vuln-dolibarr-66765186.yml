  message: 'Detected a potential XSS vulnerability due to insufficient validation
    of `onmouseover` event handlers in HTML content. This can allow attackers to inject
    malicious JavaScript code, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. To fix
    this, ensure that all event handlers are properly sanitized or use a broader pattern
    to catch all variations of mouse-related event handlers.
