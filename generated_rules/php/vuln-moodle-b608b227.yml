  message: 'The code incorrectly sets the HTTPS status based solely on the `https`
    attribute, without considering the actual protocol of the root URL. This can lead
    to incorrect security assumptions and potential vulnerabilities in handling secure
    connections. The fix should include checking the protocol of the root URL (`$CFG->httpswwwroot`)
    to ensure proper HTTPS handling.
