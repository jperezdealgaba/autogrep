  message: 'Detected a potential path traversal vulnerability due to insufficient
    validation of file paths.

    The code allows potentially untrusted file paths without proper validation, which
    could lead to unauthorized access to files.

    To fix this, ensure that file paths are validated using a regex pattern to prevent
    directory traversal attacks.
