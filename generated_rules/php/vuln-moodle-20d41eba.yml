  message: 'Missing session key (sesskey) in moodle_url construction for related_action.php.

    This is dangerous because it can lead to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks,

    allowing unauthorized actions to be performed on behalf of the user.

    To fix this, ensure that the `sesskey` parameter is included in the URL parameters.
