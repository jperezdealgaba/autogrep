  message: 'The vulnerability involves insufficient file extension filtering in the
    file upload functionality. The original code only filters `.php` and `.phtml`
    extensions, but fails to block `.phar` files, which can also execute PHP code.
    This can allow attackers to upload malicious files and execute arbitrary code
    on the server. The fix includes adding `.phar` to the list of filtered extensions.
    Always ensure all potentially dangerous file extensions are properly filtered
    in file upload handlers.
