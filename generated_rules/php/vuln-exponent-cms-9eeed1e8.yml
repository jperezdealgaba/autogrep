  message: 'The code directly uses user-provided input (`$this->params[''id'']`) without
    proper authorization checks, potentially allowing unauthorized access to edit
    or delete records. This can lead to privilege escalation or data manipulation
    by unauthorized users. Ensure that any operation involving user input validates
    the user''s permissions, typically by checking if the user is an admin or if the
    user is modifying their own data.
