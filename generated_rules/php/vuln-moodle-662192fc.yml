  message: 'In Moodle, the previous group visibility check was insufficient and could
    allow unauthorized access to user profiles. The code previously checked only if
    the user could view the profile, which did not properly account for group visibility
    in courses with separate groups. This could lead to information disclosure. The
    fix replaces this check with `groups_user_groups_visible()`, which properly handles
    group visibility. To fix this, always use `groups_user_groups_visible()` when
    checking group visibility in Moodle.
