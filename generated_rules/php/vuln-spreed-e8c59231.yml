  message: 'The method `setType` allows switching the type of a room even if it is
    a one-to-one call, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.
    This was fixed by adding a parameter `$allowSwitchingOneToOne` to control whether
    switching from a one-to-one call is allowed. To fix this, ensure that the method
    includes this parameter and checks it before allowing the type change.
