  message: 'The user creation lacks the ''access content overview'' permission, which
    can lead to unauthorized access to the content overview page. This is dangerous
    because it may expose sensitive content information to users who should not have
    access. To fix this, ensure that users who need to access the content overview
    page have the ''access content overview'' permission.
