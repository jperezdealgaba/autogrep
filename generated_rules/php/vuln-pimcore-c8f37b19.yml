  message: 'Detected a potential security vulnerability where admin privileges are
    checked multiple times within the same condition. This can lead to inconsistent
    privilege checks and potential privilege escalation. The issue was fixed by storing
    the result of `$this->getAdminUser()->isAdmin()` in a variable and reusing it.
    To fix this, store the result of privilege checks in a variable and use that variable
    in subsequent conditions.
