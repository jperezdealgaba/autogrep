  message: 'The `escapeChildren` property is set to false, which can lead to XSS vulnerabilities
    when rendering untrusted content. This is dangerous because it allows malicious
    input to be interpreted as CSS, potentially leading to style injection attacks.
    To fix this, set `escapeChildren` to true to ensure proper escaping of content.
