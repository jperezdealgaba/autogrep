  message: 'Detected a vulnerability where the environment is determined based on
    the HTTP_HOST header, which can be manipulated by an attacker. This can lead to
    unintended behavior or exposure of sensitive information. Instead, use a secure
    method to determine the environment, such as checking a server variable set by
    the web server configuration.
