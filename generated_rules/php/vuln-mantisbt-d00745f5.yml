  message: 'The vulnerability involves using `$_SERVER[''PHP_SELF'']` directly without
    proper sanitization, which can lead to security issues such as XSS (Cross-Site
    Scripting). This is dangerous because it allows attackers to inject malicious
    scripts into the application. To fix this, use `$_SERVER[''SCRIPT_NAME'']` instead
    and sanitize the input using `filter_var()` with `FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING`. Additionally,
    ensure that the path does not contain potentially harmful sequences by checking
    for ''&#''.
