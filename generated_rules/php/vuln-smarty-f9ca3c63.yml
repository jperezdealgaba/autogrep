  message: 'Detected unsafe directory path handling in Smarty template engine. The
    vulnerability occurs when the directory path is constructed before validating
    the real path, which could allow directory traversal attacks. This can be exploited
    to access files outside the intended directory. The fix ensures that the real
    path is validated before constructing the directory path. To fix this, always
    validate the real path before using it in directory operations.
