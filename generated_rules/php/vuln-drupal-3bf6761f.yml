  message: 'The use of `reset()` on an array can lead to unintended behavior, especially
    when the array is modified elsewhere in the code. This can cause security issues,
    such as incorrect file handling or access control bypasses. Use `array_shift()`
    to ensure the first element is removed and returned, preventing potential inconsistencies.
