  message: 'The function `enrol_course_delete` is called without specifying a user
    ID, which can lead to unauthorized removal of enrolments. This vulnerability allows
    any user with restore permissions to delete all enrolments in a course, regardless
    of their specific permissions. To fix this, ensure that the `enrol_course_delete`
    function is called with a valid user ID parameter to restrict the deletion to
    only those enrolments the user has permission to remove.
