  message: 'Detected insecure use of `unzip` command with direct grep for PHP files.
    This can lead to security vulnerabilities by allowing malicious users to execute
    arbitrary PHP code. The fix uses `zipinfo` and a more secure pattern matching.
    Always validate and sanitize file operations to prevent code execution vulnerabilities.
