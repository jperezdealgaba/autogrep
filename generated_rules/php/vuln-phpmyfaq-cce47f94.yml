  message: 'The code is vulnerable to CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks because
    it performs sensitive actions without verifying the CSRF token. This allows attackers
    to trick users into performing unintended actions. To fix this, ensure that all
    sensitive actions are protected by a CSRF token, and verify the token before performing
    the action.
