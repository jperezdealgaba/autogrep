  message: 'The code is vulnerable to XSS attacks due to insufficient sanitization
    of HTML attributes. The `preg_replace` function does not remove the `ontoggle`
    attribute, which can be exploited to execute malicious JavaScript. This can lead
    to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. To fix this, ensure that all event
    handler attributes, including `ontoggle`, are removed from HTML strings.
