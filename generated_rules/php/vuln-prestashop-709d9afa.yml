  message: 'The code allows reordering without verifying if the customer is logged
    in, which could lead to unauthorized access to order details.

    This is dangerous because it could allow attackers to manipulate or view orders
    they should not have access to.

    To fix this, ensure that the customer is logged in before processing the reorder
    request.
