  message: 'Detected potential command injection vulnerability due to improper handling
    of file paths starting with a dash. When passing user-controlled file paths to
    shell commands, paths starting with ''-'' can be interpreted as command options,
    leading to arbitrary command execution. To fix this, prepend ''./'' to paths that
    start with a dash before passing them to shell commands.
