  message: 'The code directly assigns a value from `$_REQUEST[''mid'']` to `$mid`
    without any validation.

    This is dangerous as it can lead to security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection
    or XSS if the input is not properly sanitized.

    Always validate and sanitize user inputs before using them. In this case, the
    `validCardinal` function should be used to ensure the input is a valid integer.
