  message: 'The code is missing a check for bugnote attachment permissions, which
    could allow unauthorized access to sensitive files. This vulnerability occurs
    because the code only checks if the user can download bug attachments but does
    not verify if they have permission to download bugnote attachments. To fix this,
    ensure that both `file_can_download_bug_attachments` and `file_can_download_bugnote_attachments`
    are checked before allowing file downloads.
