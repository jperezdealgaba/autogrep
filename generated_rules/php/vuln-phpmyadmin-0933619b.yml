  message: 'Unsafe use of unsanitized input in sprintf() can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

    The variable $theme is directly used in sprintf() without sanitization, which
    can allow an attacker to inject malicious code.

    To fix this, use PMA_sanitize() to sanitize the input before using it in sprintf().
