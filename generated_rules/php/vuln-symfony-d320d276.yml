  message: 'A security vulnerability exists where fragment URLs are not properly validated
    when a controller is already defined.

    This could allow attackers to bypass security checks by manipulating fragment
    URLs.

    To fix this, ensure that fragment validation is only performed when no controller
    is defined.
