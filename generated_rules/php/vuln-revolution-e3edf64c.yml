  message: 'The code uses `basename()` directly on user-controlled input, which can
    lead to path traversal vulnerabilities. This is dangerous because an attacker
    could manipulate the `$topic` variable to access unauthorized directories or files.
    To fix this, use a sanitization function like `sanitizePath()` from a file handler
    service to ensure the path is safe.
