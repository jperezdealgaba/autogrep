  message: 'The code is vulnerable to file extension validation bypass. The original
    method `isMatchingExtension` did not properly validate file extensions, potentially
    allowing malicious file uploads. This could lead to security risks such as remote
    code execution. Ensure file extensions are validated using a whitelist approach,
    as implemented in the fixed version with `validateFileExtension`.
