  message: 'Detected a logic flaw in message access control. The original condition
    incorrectly checks for the existence of $user2 before verifying if the current
    user is involved in the conversation. This could allow unauthorized access to
    messages. The fix ensures proper validation by first checking if $user2 is empty
    or if the current user is not involved in the conversation. Always validate user
    permissions carefully when handling sensitive data like messages.
