  message: 'This rule detects a vulnerability where the code fails to properly validate
    input data before processing it. The original code would return `true` even if
    validation errors were present, potentially allowing invalid or malicious data
    to be processed. This could lead to security issues such as data corruption or
    injection attacks. The fix ensures that the function returns early if validation
    errors are detected, preventing further processing of invalid data. To fix this,
    always check for validation errors and return early if any are found.
