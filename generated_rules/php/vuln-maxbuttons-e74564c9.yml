  message: 'Detected a potential security vulnerability where user input is not properly
    validated.

    The code checks if ''id'' is set and not empty but does not validate that it is
    a non-zero integer.

    This could lead to SQL injection or other security issues if the input is used
    in a query.

    To fix this, ensure that ''id'' is validated as a non-zero integer using intval().
