  message: 'The composer.json file includes a direct reference to a specific file
    in the vendor directory, which can lead to security issues. This practice is dangerous
    because it can expose internal files or create dependencies on specific file paths
    that may change. Instead, rely on autoloading mechanisms provided by Composer.
