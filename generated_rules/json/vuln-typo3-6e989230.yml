  message: 'The dependency "typo3/html-sanitizer" version 2.1.3 is vulnerable and
    should be updated to version 2.1.4 or higher. This vulnerability could lead to
    security issues such as HTML injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) if the sanitizer
    does not properly handle malicious input. To fix this, update the dependency to
