  message: 'The ''assign'' field is set to null (~), which can lead to security vulnerabilities
    by not enforcing proper role and membership limitations. This can allow unauthorized
    access to sensitive resources. To fix this, explicitly define the ''assign'' field
    with ''MemberOf'' and ''Role'' set to true.
