  message: 'The workflow is missing a ''needs'' dependency, which can cause race conditions
    or incorrect execution order. This is dangerous because it may lead to inconsistent
    builds or failures. Fix it by ensuring all necessary dependencies are explicitly
    listed in the ''needs'' section.
