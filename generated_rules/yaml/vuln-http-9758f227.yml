  message: 'The ''Max'' value in the .rubocop.yml file is set to 100, which is too
    restrictive and can lead to unnecessary code refactoring. Increasing the value
    to 110 allows for more flexibility and reduces the risk of introducing bugs during
    refactoring. Update the ''Max'' value to 110 to avoid this issue.
