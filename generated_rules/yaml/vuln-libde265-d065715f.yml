  message: 'The version format in the YAML file is insecure as it uses a dynamic build
    number without a fixed prefix.

    This can lead to inconsistent versioning and potential security issues due to
    unpredictable build identifiers.

    Ensure the version format includes a fixed prefix followed by the build number,
    e.g., ''1.0.{build}''.
