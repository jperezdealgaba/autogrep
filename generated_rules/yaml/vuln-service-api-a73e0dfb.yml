  message: 'The use of ''buildDocker'' in the build script can lead to insecure Docker
    image builds.

    This command may include unnecessary or insecure layers in the Docker image, increasing
    the attack surface.

    Replace ''buildDocker'' with ''build'' to ensure a secure and minimal build process.
