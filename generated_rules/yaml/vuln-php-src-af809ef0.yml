  message: 'The workflow uses `github.event.pull_request.head.sha` which can be unsafe
    as it relies on the pull request''s head SHA. This can be manipulated by an attacker.
    Use `github.sha` instead, which is more secure and reliable.

    - Why it''s dangerous: Using `github.event.pull_request.head.sha` can lead to
    potential security issues as it can be influenced by external actors.

    - How to fix it: Replace `github.event.pull_request.head.sha` with `github.sha`
    to ensure the correct SHA is used.
