  message: 'Detected unsafe usage of `get_scope` followed by `init` with a closure.
    This pattern can lead to undefined behavior due to improper handling of raw pointers
    and lifetimes. The `scoped_init` method should be used instead, which safely manages
    the scope and closure initialization.
