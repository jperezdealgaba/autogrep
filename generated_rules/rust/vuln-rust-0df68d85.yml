  message: 'Detected unsafe plugin loading in Rust code. This vulnerability allows
    loading arbitrary dynamic libraries, which can lead to code execution. The issue
    was fixed by removing the ability to specify plugin paths and names. Ensure that
    your code does not load plugins from untrusted sources. See CVE-2018-1000622 for
    more details.
