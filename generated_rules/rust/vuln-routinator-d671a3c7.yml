  message: 'Detected use of the deprecated `process()` method instead of `process_origins()`.

    This can lead to incorrect validation of route origins in RPKI repositories.

    The vulnerability was fixed by replacing `process()` with `process_origins()`

    to properly handle route origin attestations. Always use `process_origins()`

    for correct validation of RPKI data.
