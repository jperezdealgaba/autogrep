  message: 'The function `slurm_xmalloc` is declared with `size_t` as the first parameter,
    which can lead to potential integer overflow vulnerabilities. This is dangerous
    because it can cause memory allocation failures or buffer overflows. The fix involves
    changing the parameter type to `uint64_t` to ensure safe handling of large values.
    Always use appropriate types for memory allocation functions to prevent such vulnerabilities.
