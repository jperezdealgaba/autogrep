  message: 'Detected a potential unsafe lock type assignment that could lead to replication
    discrepancies.

    The code directly assigns TL_READ_NO_INSERT or TL_READ based on a condition, which
    can cause

    inconsistencies between master and slave in statement-based replication. Instead,
    use the

    read_lock_type_for_table function to determine the appropriate lock type based
    on the

    binary log format and table category.
