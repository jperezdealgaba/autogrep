  message: 'Detected a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to incorrect bounds
    checking.

    The original code checks if the offset is greater than size-2, which can lead
    to accessing memory beyond the intended bounds.

    This can result in memory corruption or crashes. The fix ensures proper bounds
    checking by verifying that the offset plus the required size does not exceed the
    total size.

    Always ensure that bounds checks are correctly implemented to prevent buffer overflows.
