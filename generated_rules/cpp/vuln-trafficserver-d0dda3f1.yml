  message: 'The vulnerability occurs when cache promotion logic does not check if
    the request is cacheable before promoting it. This can lead to incorrect cache
    promotions for non-cacheable requests, potentially causing resource exhaustion
    or cache poisoning. The fix involves adding a cacheable check before promoting
    the request. Ensure that cache promotion logic verifies request cacheability using
    appropriate headers and methods.
