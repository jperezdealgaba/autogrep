  message: 'Detected potential buffer size calculation vulnerability. The buffer size
    calculation does not account for the method size, which could lead to insufficient
    buffer allocation and potential overflow. This issue was part of CVE-2019-18801.
    Ensure that the buffer size calculation includes both the path and method sizes
    to prevent such vulnerabilities.
