  message: "The use of the logical OR operator (`||`) in this condition may lead to\
    \ incorrect behavior or security vulnerabilities. \nThis is dangerous because\
    \ it can cause the condition to evaluate to true even if only one of the elements\
    \ is non-zero, \npotentially leading to unintended operations or data corruption.\
    \ \nTo fix this, replace the OR operator (`||`) with the AND operator (`&&`) to\
    \ ensure both conditions are properly checked.\n"
