  message: 'The buffer size for the input array is insufficient, which can lead to
    buffer overflow when reading large blocks of data. This vulnerability is dangerous
    because it can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
    service. To fix this, use the defined constant CAB_INPUTBUF to ensure the buffer
    is large enough to handle the maximum input size plus an additional byte for alignment.
