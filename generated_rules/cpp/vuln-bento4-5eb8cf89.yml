  message: 'Detected a potential integer overflow vulnerability due to improper type
    casting.

    Comparing a character directly with an integer can lead to unexpected behavior
    if the character value exceeds the expected range.

    To fix this, ensure proper type casting is used when comparing characters with
    integers.
