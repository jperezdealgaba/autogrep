  message: 'The function decodeSample is called without checking for potential overflow
    or errors, which can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This vulnerability
    was fixed by adding an overflow check and an error handling mechanism. Always
    check for potential overflow when performing arithmetic operations, especially
    in audio processing where large values can be common.
