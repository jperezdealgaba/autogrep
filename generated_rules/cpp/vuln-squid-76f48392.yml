  message: 'The code is missing a check for the `waitingForDns` flag, which could
    lead to a race condition or incorrect state management when handling DNS lookups.
    This vulnerability could cause the application to proceed with operations before
    DNS resolution is complete, potentially leading to undefined behavior or security
    issues. To fix this, ensure the `waitingForDns` flag is included in the condition
    check.
