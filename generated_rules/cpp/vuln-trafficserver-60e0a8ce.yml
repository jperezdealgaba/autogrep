  message: 'The code contains a vulnerability where the amount of data to write is
    not properly adjusted when the producer is not alive. This can lead to incorrect
    data handling and potential security issues. The fix involves using the `final_consumer_bytes_to_write`
    function to correctly calculate the amount of data to write when the producer
    is not alive.
