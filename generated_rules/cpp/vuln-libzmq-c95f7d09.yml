  message: 'The vulnerability arises from a missing check on the `options.type` in
    the conditional statement. This could lead to processing user messages incorrectly
    when the type is `ZMQ_PUB`, which should never process user messages. This can
    cause unexpected behavior or security issues in the application. To fix this,
    ensure the condition includes a check for `options.type != ZMQ_PUB`.
