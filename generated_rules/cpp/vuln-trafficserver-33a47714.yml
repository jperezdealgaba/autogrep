  message: 'The code checks if `_cur` is equal to 1 but does not validate the HTTP
    method, which could lead to incorrect handling of CONNECT requests. This vulnerability
    could allow unauthorized or unsafe processing of requests. To fix this, ensure
    that the HTTP method is also checked to prevent improper handling of CONNECT requests.
