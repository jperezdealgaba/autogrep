  message: 'The code creates a Compressor object to determine the number of scanlines
    in a buffer, which is then immediately deleted. This is inefficient and unnecessary
    since the compression type can be accessed directly from the header. This pattern
    can lead to resource leaks if the delete statement is missed or if an exception
    is thrown before it is reached. To fix, directly use the compression type from
    the header instead of creating a Compressor object.
