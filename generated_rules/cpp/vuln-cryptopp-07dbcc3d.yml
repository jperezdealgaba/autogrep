  message: 'The code directly accesses an array without proper bounds checking, which
    can lead to out-of-bounds access and potential memory corruption. The vulnerability
    occurs when `m_distance` is greater than or equal to the size of the array, leading
    to undefined behavior. The fix involves adding explicit bounds checking and throwing
    an exception when the index is out of bounds.
