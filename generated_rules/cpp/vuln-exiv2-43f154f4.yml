  message: 'The code contains separate enforce calls for length validation, which
    can lead to inconsistent checks and bypassing of security constraints. This is
    dangerous because it can allow invalid or malicious data to pass through unchecked.
    Consolidate the checks into a single enforce call to ensure both conditions are
    evaluated together.
