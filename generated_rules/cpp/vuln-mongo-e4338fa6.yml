  message: 'The function `getInequalityPredicateTightness` was called with incorrect
    parameters, potentially leading to incorrect query results. The vulnerability
    occurs when the function is called with only two arguments instead of the required
    three, which includes the `Interval` parameter. This can cause incorrect bounds
    calculation, especially for null values. Always ensure that the `Interval` parameter
    is passed to the function to maintain correct query behavior.
