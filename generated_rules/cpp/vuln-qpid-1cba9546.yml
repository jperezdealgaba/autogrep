  message: 'Detected a potential security vulnerability where SSL/TLS connections
    may not have a timeout mechanism for protocol negotiation. This can lead to resource
    exhaustion or denial of service attacks by keeping connections open indefinitely.
    The issue was fixed by adding a `Timer` and `maxTime` parameter to enforce a timeout.
    To fix this vulnerability, ensure that SSL/TLS connections include a timeout mechanism
    for protocol negotiation.
