  message: 'The condition in this if statement is incomplete, potentially leading
    to incorrect behavior. The original code only checks `cparams.resampling > 1`
    but should also include `frame_info.is_preview` in the condition. This could result
    in improper handling of progressive DC settings for preview frames. To fix this,
    ensure the condition includes both `cparams.resampling > 1` and `frame_info.is_preview`.
