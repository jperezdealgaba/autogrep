  message: 'Uninitialized pointer variables can lead to undefined behavior and potential
    security vulnerabilities. Always initialize pointer variables to nullptr when
    declaring them to ensure they have a defined state and prevent accidental use
    of uninitialized memory. In this case, the NodeDef pointer was declared without
    initialization, which could lead to undefined behavior if used before assignment.
    The fix adds initialization to nullptr.
