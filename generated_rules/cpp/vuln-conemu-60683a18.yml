  message: 'The code does not properly handle the escape character (0x1B), which can
    lead to incorrect processing of ANSI escape sequences. This can result in security
    vulnerabilities such as command injection or misinterpretation of control sequences.
    To fix this, ensure that the escape character is explicitly checked in the condition.
