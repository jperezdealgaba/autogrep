  message: 'The return statement directly adds constants and variables without considering
    the expected size, which can lead to incorrect buffer size calculations. This
    is dangerous as it may cause buffer overflows or underflows, leading to memory
    corruption or crashes. The fix involves returning the expected size directly,
    ensuring proper buffer allocation.
