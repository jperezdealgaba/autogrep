  message: 'The ConnectionCounter constructor is missing a reference to the Acl object,
    which is required for proper reporting of connection limits. This can lead to
    incomplete logging and monitoring of connection denials, potentially masking security
    issues. Update the constructor to include the Acl reference as shown in the patch.
