  message: 'Directly constructing TensorShape with initializer list can lead to potential
    vulnerabilities due to hardcoded dimensions. Instead, use TensorShape::AddDimWithStatus
    to dynamically add dimensions, which is safer and more flexible.

    This vulnerability can cause issues in tensor allocation, leading to incorrect
    tensor shapes or potential memory corruption.

    To fix this, replace the direct TensorShape initialization with a series of AddDimWithStatus
    calls.
