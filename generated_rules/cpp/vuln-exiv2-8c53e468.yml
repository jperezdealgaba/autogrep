  message: 'Detected multiple calls to `xmlParser->ParseBuffer()` with potentially
    overlapping buffer regions, which can lead to quadratic complexity and performance
    degradation. This vulnerability was fixed by using a single `std::string` to accumulate
    the buffer contents before parsing. Replace repeated `ParseBuffer()` calls with
    a single call using a pre-processed buffer.
