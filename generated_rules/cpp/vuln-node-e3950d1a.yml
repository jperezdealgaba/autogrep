  message: 'The code fails to validate the ''Host'' header in HTTP GET requests, which
    can lead to security vulnerabilities such as DNS rebinding attacks. An attacker
    could exploit this to bypass security restrictions by providing a malicious host.
    The fix adds validation using the IsAllowedHost function to ensure the host is
    either localhost, an IP address, or empty.
