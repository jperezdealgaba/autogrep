  message: 'The use of `ObjectType::Object` instead of `ObjectType::UninitializedObject`
    can lead to incorrect object initialization, potentially causing undefined behavior
    or security vulnerabilities. This issue was fixed by replacing `ObjectType::Object`
    with `ObjectType::UninitializedObject` in the ChakraCore repository. Ensure that
    objects are properly initialized to avoid such risks.
