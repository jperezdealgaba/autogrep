  message: 'The function `negotiateSpawn` calls `handleSpawnResponse` without passing
    the `SpawnPreparationInfo` object, which is required for validating the socket
    address. This can lead to security vulnerabilities where the socket address is
    not properly validated, potentially allowing unauthorized access or incorrect
    socket usage. Always pass the `SpawnPreparationInfo` object to ensure proper validation
    of socket addresses.
