  message: 'The code directly uses `dup()` without proper error handling, which can
    lead to undefined behavior if the system call fails. This is dangerous because
    it can cause the application to continue running in an inconsistent state. The
    fix involves using a wrapper function `dupOrExit` that properly handles errors
    by reporting them and exiting the process.
