  message: 'Detected unsafe usage of LoadLibrary without specifying the search path.
    This can lead to DLL hijacking vulnerabilities where an attacker could place a
    malicious DLL in a directory that is searched before the system directory. Use
    LoadLibraryEx with LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_SYSTEM32 to ensure the DLL is loaded only
    from the system directory.
