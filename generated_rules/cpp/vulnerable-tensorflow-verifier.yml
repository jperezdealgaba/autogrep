  message: 'The TensorFlow Lite model verifier is being called without the required
    resolver and error reporter arguments.

    This can lead to incorrect verification of model buffers and potentially allow
    malformed models to pass verification.

    Always use the full Verify() function with both resolver and error reporter arguments.
