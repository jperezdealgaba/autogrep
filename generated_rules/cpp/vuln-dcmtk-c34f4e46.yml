  message: 'The code conditionally drops and destroys associations based on a check
    for single process mode and shutdown application condition. This can lead to resource
    leaks or incomplete cleanup if the conditions are not met. The fix ensures that
    associations are always dropped and destroyed properly, regardless of the conditions.
    To fix this, remove the conditional check and always perform the cleanup operations.
