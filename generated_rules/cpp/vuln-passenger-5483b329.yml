  message: 'Detected insecure directory creation using `makeDirTree` without proper
    existence and type checks. This can lead to race conditions where an attacker
    could create a directory just before the application does, potentially leading
    to privilege escalation or unauthorized access. Use `mkdir` with proper error
    handling and existence checks to ensure the directory is created securely.
