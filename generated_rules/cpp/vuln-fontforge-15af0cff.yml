  message: 'The use of a hardcoded array size ''FORMER_MAX'' can lead to buffer overflow
    vulnerabilities if the array size is insufficient. This was fixed by increasing
    the array size to ''CV_TABMAX''. Always ensure that array sizes are large enough
    to handle expected data and consider using dynamic memory allocation if the size
    is not known at compile time.
