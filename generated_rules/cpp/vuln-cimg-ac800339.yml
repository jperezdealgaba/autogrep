  message: 'This code calculates a buffer size based on multiplication of dynamic
    values, which can lead to integer overflow and subsequent memory corruption. The
    vulnerability occurs because the buffer size is computed as `cimg::abs(dy) * (dx_bytes
    + align_bytes)`, which can exceed the maximum allocatable size. This can be exploited
    to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code. The fix replaces
    the dynamic calculation with a precomputed `buf_size` to ensure safe allocation.
