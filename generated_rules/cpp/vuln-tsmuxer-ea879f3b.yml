  message: 'The original code checks the value of the buffer before verifying its
    bounds, which can lead to out-of-bounds memory access. This is dangerous because
    it can cause crashes, undefined behavior, or even security vulnerabilities like
    arbitrary code execution. Always check buffer bounds before accessing the contents.
    Fix by swapping the order of the conditions in the loop.
