  message: 'The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to incorrect
    pointer arithmetic in the Slice function. The original code does not account for
    the channel sampling rate when calculating the offset, which could lead to accessing
    memory outside the intended bounds. This can cause undefined behavior, crashes,
    or even security vulnerabilities. To fix this, ensure that the offset calculation
    includes the channel sampling rate by dividing the delta (dx or dwx) by the xSampling
    value.
