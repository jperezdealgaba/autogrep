  message: 'The code uses a less efficient and potentially unsafe pattern for loading
    and expanding data using `v_load` and `v_extract`. This can lead to performance
    issues and potential memory access errors. Instead, use `v_load_expand` directly,
    which is both safer and more efficient. This change was made in the OpenCV commit
    3ece62cb9c62c66d3fcc314eb5327aa4c5bcb701 to improve performance and safety.
