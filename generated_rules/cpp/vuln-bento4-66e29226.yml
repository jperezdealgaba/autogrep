  message: 'This code checks if the payload size is less than 3, which can lead to
    insufficient data validation. The minimum required payload size should be 4 to
    ensure proper data handling. This vulnerability can cause undefined behavior or
    crashes when processing malformed input. Fix by changing the condition to check
    for payload size less than 4.
