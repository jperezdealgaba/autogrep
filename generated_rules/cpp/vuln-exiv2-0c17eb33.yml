  message: 'The code uses an assertion to validate a size condition, which can be
    disabled in production builds, leading to potential buffer overflows. This is
    dangerous because it can result in memory corruption, crashes, or even arbitrary
    code execution. To fix this, replace the assertion with a proper conditional check
    to ensure the size validation is always enforced.
