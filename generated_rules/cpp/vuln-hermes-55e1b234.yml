  message: "The use of `llvm_unreachable` in this context can lead to undefined behavior\
    \ if the code path is actually reached. \nThis is dangerous because it assumes\
    \ the code path is unreachable, which may not be true in all cases, potentially\
    \ causing crashes or unexpected behavior. \nReplace `llvm_unreachable` with a\
    \ proper handling mechanism, such as a `break` statement, to ensure safe execution.\n"
