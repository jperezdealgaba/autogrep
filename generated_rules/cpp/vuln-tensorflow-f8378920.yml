  message: 'The code is vulnerable to incorrect handling of null buffers in the reshape
    operator.

    When the second input tensor (i == 1) is used for the shape and has a size of
    1, a null buffer is incorrectly considered acceptable.

    This can lead to incorrect tensor reshaping and potential data corruption.

    To fix this, ensure that the null buffer is only accepted when the tensor dimensions
    are not equal to 1.
