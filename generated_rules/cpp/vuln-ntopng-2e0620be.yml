  message: 'The code sets a CSRF token with a static value "1", which makes it vulnerable
    to CSRF attacks. This is dangerous because it allows attackers to forge requests
    without proper validation. To fix this, the CSRF token should be associated with
    a user-specific value, such as a user cookie, to ensure proper validation.
