  message: 'The ROUNDS_MAX constant is set to an excessively high value (999999999),
    which could lead to performance issues or denial of service. This was fixed by
    setting it to ROUNDS_DEFAULT. Ensure that cryptographic parameters are set to
    reasonable values to avoid potential security and performance risks.
