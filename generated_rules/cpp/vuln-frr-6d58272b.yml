  message: 'The structure ''capability'' contains a direct reference to ''capability_mp'',
    which lacks proper alignment and packing. This can lead to memory misalignment
    issues and potential security vulnerabilities. Use ''capability_mp_data'' instead
    and ensure proper packing with ''#pragma pack'' directives.
