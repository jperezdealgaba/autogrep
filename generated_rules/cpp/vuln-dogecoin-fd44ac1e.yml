  message: 'The code uses a raw pair of `CWalletTx*` and `unsigned int` instead of
    the `CInputCoin` type, which is a safer and more maintainable abstraction. This
    can lead to potential issues in coin selection logic and reduce code clarity.
    Replace with `CInputCoin` to ensure better type safety and maintainability.
