  message: 'Detected a missing check for `transport_wants_read_` in read buffer condition.
    This can lead to missed read resumptions when data is held in transport socket
    internal buffers, potentially causing connection stalls or incomplete data processing.
    Ensure to check both `read_buffer_.length() > 0` and `transport_wants_read_` to
    properly handle read resumptions.
