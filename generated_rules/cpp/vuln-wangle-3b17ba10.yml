  message: 'Detected a potentially unsafe dynamic cast to `folly::AsyncSocket` without
    a subsequent null check. This can lead to null pointer dereferences if the cast
    fails. The fix involves casting to `folly::AsyncTransportWrapper` and adding a
    null check using `CHECK` to ensure the cast was successful. This prevents crashes
    and undefined behavior in case of a failed cast.
