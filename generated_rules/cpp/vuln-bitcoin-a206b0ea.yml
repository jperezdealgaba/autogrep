  message: 'Detected a potentially unsafe transaction index erasure pattern. Failing
    to erase a transaction index can lead to transaction duplication attacks where
    older transactions can be overwritten, allowing for double-spending or coinbase
    duplication. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous as it can enable the
    removal of the ability to spend the first instance of a transaction even after
    being sent to another address. Always handle transaction index erasure carefully,
    considering BIP30 rules and potential reorganization scenarios.
