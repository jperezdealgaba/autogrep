  message: 'The use of VERIFY to check string length without proper error handling
    can lead to undefined behavior if the condition fails. This is dangerous because
    it may cause the program to continue execution in an invalid state, potentially
    leading to crashes or security vulnerabilities. Replace VERIFY with a proper conditional
    check that throws an exception or handles the error appropriately.
