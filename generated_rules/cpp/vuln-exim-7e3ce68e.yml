  message: 'The enumeration `chunking_state_t` is missing an explicit initializer
    for `CHUNKING_NOT_OFFERED`, which can lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    state handling. This vulnerability was fixed by explicitly setting `CHUNKING_NOT_OFFERED
    = -1` to ensure consistent and predictable behavior. To fix this, always explicitly
    initialize enumeration values to avoid ambiguity.
