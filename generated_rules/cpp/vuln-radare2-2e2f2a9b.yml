  message: 'The use of signed integers for IMMS and IMMU operations can lead to incorrect
    value interpretations and potential security vulnerabilities. This is dangerous
    because it may cause unexpected behavior or security flaws in the code. To fix
    this, use unsigned integers to ensure proper value handling.
