  message: 'Directly using StackSym::FindOrCreate without checking if the environment
    register needs special handling can lead to incorrect optimization. When dealing
    with nested functions, the environment register might become boxed during execution
    and needs to be loaded fresh each time. This vulnerability could cause incorrect
    behavior in optimized code. Fix by checking if the function does stack nested
    functions and if the symID matches the environment register, and handle it appropriately
    by loading the environment fresh each time.
