  message: 'The buffer size for ''timeBuf'' is too small (32 bytes), which could lead
    to buffer overflow vulnerabilities when handling large time strings. This is dangerous
    as it can result in memory corruption, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.
    Increase the buffer size to at least 128 bytes to safely accommodate the time
    string.
