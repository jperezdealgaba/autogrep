  message: 'The code constructs a switch name directly from a string without converting
    it to lowercase, which could lead to inconsistent behavior or security issues
    due to case sensitivity. This is dangerous because it can cause mismatches in
    case-sensitive environments, potentially bypassing security checks or causing
    unexpected behavior. To fix this, use `base::ToLowerASCII` to ensure the switch
    name is in lowercase.
