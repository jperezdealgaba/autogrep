  message: 'The original code conditionally assigns a new PPS (Picture Parameter Set)
    only if the operation was successful, but fails to handle the case where the operation
    is not successful, potentially leading to inconsistent state or undefined behavior.
    The fix ensures that the PPS is always assigned and returns the appropriate warning
    when the operation fails.

    This vulnerability is dangerous because it can lead to unexpected behavior or
    crashes in the video decoding process. To fix it, ensure that the PPS is always
    assigned and handle the failure case explicitly.
