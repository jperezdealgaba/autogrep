  message: 'The code performs arithmetic operations without proper type casting, which
    can lead to integer overflows. This is dangerous because it can cause unexpected
    behavior, memory corruption, or security vulnerabilities. To fix this, use `static_cast<size_t>`
    to ensure the arithmetic operations are performed with the correct type.
