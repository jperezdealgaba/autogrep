  message: 'Detected a potential vulnerability related to CVE-2022-43705 in Botan.
    The code tests a path check with a forged OCSP using a self-signed certificate
    without the CVE identifier, indicating it may be using an older, vulnerable version.
    This vulnerability could allow attackers to forge OCSP responses, leading to potential
    security bypasses. Update the code to include the CVE identifier and ensure the
    latest security patches are applied.
