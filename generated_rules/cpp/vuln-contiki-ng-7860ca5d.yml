  message: 'The DB_VM_BYTECODE_SIZE is set to a potentially insufficient value of
    128, which could lead to buffer overflows or other memory-related vulnerabilities.
    This value was increased to 256 in the patch to ensure adequate space for bytecode
    operations. To fix this, increase the value of DB_VM_BYTECODE_SIZE to 256 or higher,
    depending on the application''s requirements.
