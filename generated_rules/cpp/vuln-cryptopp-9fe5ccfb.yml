  message: 'Detected incorrect pointer alignment check. The function `IsAlignedOn`
    is being called with `GetAlignmentOf<T*>()`, which checks alignment for a pointer
    to `T` instead of `T` itself. This can lead to incorrect alignment validation,
    potentially causing undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities. Fix by using
    `GetAlignmentOf<T>()` to check alignment for the type `T` directly.
