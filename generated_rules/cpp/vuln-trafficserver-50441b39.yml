  message: 'The HTTP/2 initial window size is set to an excessively large value (1048576),
    which can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service. This vulnerability
    allows an attacker to consume excessive memory by opening multiple streams with
    large window sizes. Update the initial window size to the recommended value of
    65535 to mitigate this risk.
