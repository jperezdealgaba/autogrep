  message: 'The DEFAULT_XML constant is set to RECOVER without the NONET flag, which
    can allow network access during XML parsing. This is dangerous because it can
    lead to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, where an attacker can exploit the XML
    parser to access local or remote resources. To fix this, ensure that the NONET
    flag is included to disable network access during parsing.
