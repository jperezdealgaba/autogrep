  message: 'The use of `open` without `File` prefix can lead to command injection
    vulnerabilities when the filename contains special characters.

    This is dangerous because an attacker could execute arbitrary commands by crafting
    a malicious filename.

    Always use `File.open` instead of `open` to safely handle file operations.
