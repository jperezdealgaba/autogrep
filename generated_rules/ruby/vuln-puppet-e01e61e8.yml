  message: 'Detected a vulnerability similar to CVE-2013-2275 in Puppet. The ACL configuration
    for report submission does not properly restrict access to the node matching the
    certname, potentially allowing unauthorized report submissions. To fix this, update
    the ACL pattern to include a regex that matches only the specific node and add
    the `allow` parameter to enforce the restriction.
