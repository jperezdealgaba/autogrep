  message: 'The code sets `omniauth.params` using `request.params`, which includes
    both GET and POST parameters. This can lead to security vulnerabilities by exposing
    sensitive POST data in the session. Use `request.GET` instead to only include
    query parameters and avoid exposing POST data.
