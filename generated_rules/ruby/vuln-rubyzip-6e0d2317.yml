  message: 'Detected a potential path traversal vulnerability in RubyZip''s `extract`
    method.

    The original implementation allows extraction to arbitrary paths based on the
    zip entry name,

    which could lead to files being written outside the intended directory.

    The vulnerability has been fixed by checking for absolute paths and providing
    a default destination path.

    To fix this, ensure that the destination path is validated and not directly derived
    from the zip entry name.
