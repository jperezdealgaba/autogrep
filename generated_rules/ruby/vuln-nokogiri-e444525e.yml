  message: 'The pattern matches a vulnerable regular expression in Nokogiri''s XML
    declaration detection that is susceptible to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial
    of Service). The original pattern allows for excessive backtracking when processing
    strings with many spaces, which can lead to significant performance degradation
    or denial of service. The fix removes the `+` quantifier to prevent backtracking.
    To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the regular expression does not allow for
    excessive backtracking.
