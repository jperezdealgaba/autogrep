  message: 'The regex pattern used for ATTRIBUTE_CHAR is vulnerable because it does
    not properly exclude all control characters. This can lead to security issues
    such as header injection or other parsing vulnerabilities. The fix includes excluding
    all control characters (0x00-0x1f and 0x7f) to ensure proper handling of multipart
    form data. Update the regex to include all control characters as shown in the
    fixed version.
