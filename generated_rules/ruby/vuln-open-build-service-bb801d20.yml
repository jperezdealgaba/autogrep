  message: 'The test case lacks assertions to verify the deletion of attributes, which
    could lead to undetected failures in the attribute management functionality. This
    is dangerous because it may result in incomplete or incorrect test coverage, potentially
    allowing bugs to go unnoticed. To fix this, add assertions to verify that the
    attributes are correctly deleted.
