  message: 'The method `find_for_oauth` is deprecated and insecure. It has been replaced
    with `find_for_omniauth` which includes additional security checks. Using the
    old method can lead to authentication bypass and account takeover vulnerabilities.
    Update the code to use `find_for_omniauth` instead.
