  message: 'Detected insecure package retrieval without proper link following control.

    The original code retrieves a package without disabling project link following,

    which could lead to unintended access control bypass. The fix adds the

    `follow_project_links: false` option to prevent this. Always explicitly

    control link following behavior when retrieving packages.
