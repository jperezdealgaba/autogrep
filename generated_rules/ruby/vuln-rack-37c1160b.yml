  message: 'The buffer size for multipart parsing is set to 1MB (1048576 bytes), which
    can lead to excessive memory consumption and potential denial of service (DoS)
    attacks. This is dangerous because it allows attackers to send large multipart
    payloads that consume server resources. To fix this, reduce the buffer size to
    a safer value, such as 16KB (16384 bytes).
