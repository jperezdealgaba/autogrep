  message: 'The X-XSS-Protection header is set to ''1; mode=block'', which is deprecated
    and can introduce security risks. Modern browsers have deprecated this header,
    and it can lead to vulnerabilities if not properly managed. Instead, set the X-XSS-Protection
    header to ''0'' to disable it and rely on Content Security Policy (CSP) for XSS
    protection.
