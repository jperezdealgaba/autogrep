  message: 'The backend_build_command method is being called without the required
    build_project parameter, which could lead to incorrect build operations. This
    vulnerability occurs because the project name is derived from the current context
    rather than explicitly passed, potentially causing operations to be performed
    on the wrong project. To fix this, always pass the build_project parameter explicitly
    when calling backend_build_command.
