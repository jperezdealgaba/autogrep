  message: 'Directly using `.html_safe` on joined strings can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

    The vulnerability occurs because HTML entities are not properly escaped before
    marking the content as safe.

    Instead, use `safe_join` to safely join HTML-safe strings, which properly handles
    escaping and joining.
