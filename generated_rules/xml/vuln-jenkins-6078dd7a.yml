  message: 'Using a snapshot version (2.53.3-20160211.162333-3) of a dependency can
    lead to instability and security risks because snapshot versions are not stable
    and may contain untested or vulnerable code. Always use a stable release version
    (e.g., 2.53.2) to ensure reliability and security.
