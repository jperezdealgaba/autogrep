# Autogrep

Autogrep is a tool for automatically generating and filtering Semgrep rules from vulnerability patches. It addresses a critical need in the security tooling ecosystem that emerged after Semgrep announced that their official rules are no longer available under permissive licenses. This change led to the creation of Opengrep ([opengrep/opengrep](https://github.com/opengrep/opengrep)), a community fork supported by several security vendors.

Autogrep bridges the gap by automating the creation and maintenance of high-quality security rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). Instead of relying on manual rule curation, which is time-consuming and requires constant maintenance, Autogrep automatically generates rules from known vulnerability fixes and validates them for accuracy.

The project leverages several key resources:
- [patched-codes/semgrep-rules](https://github.com/patched-codes/semgrep-rules): A collection of permissively licensed Semgrep rules used as a foundation
- [MoreFixes Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/13983082): A comprehensive dataset of CVE fix commits from the paper "MoreFixes: A Large-Scale Dataset of CVE Fix Commits Mined through Enhanced Repository Discovery"

## Features

- Automatic rule generation from vulnerability patches
- Support for multiple programming languages
- Duplicate rule detection using embeddings
- Rule quality evaluation using LLM
- Validation against original vulnerabilities
- Filtering of project-specific and low-quality rules
- Caching system for processed patches and repositories

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git installed and available in PATH
- Semgrep CLI installed
- OpenRouter API key for LLM-based rule evaluation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and the initial rule set:
```bash
# Clone Autogrep
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autogrep.git
cd autogrep

# Clone initial permissively licensed rules
git clone https://github.com/patched-codes/semgrep-rules.git rules
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install Semgrep CLI:
```bash
pip install semgrep
```

5. Download the MoreFixes dataset:
```bash
wget https://zenodo.org/records/13983082/files/cvedataset-patches.zip
unzip cvedataset-patches.zip -d cvedataset-patches
```

6. Set up your OpenRouter API key:
```bash
    export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

The project consists of two main components:

1. Rule Generation (`main.py`):
```bash
# Basic usage
python main.py --patches-dir /path/to/patches --output-dir generated_rules

# With custom models, CSV logging, and increased parallelism
python main.py --patches-dir /path/to/patches --output-dir generated_rules \
  --generation-model "openai/gpt-4" \
  --validation-model "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet" \
  --log-rules-csv \
  --max-workers 4
```

2. Rule Filtering (`rule_filter.py`):
```bash
# Basic usage
python rule_filter.py --input-dir generated_rules --output-dir filtered_rules

# With custom validation model
python rule_filter.py --input-dir generated_rules --output-dir filtered_rules \
  --validation-model "openai/gpt-4"
```

### Command Line Arguments

- `--generation-model`: LLM model for rule generation (default: "deepseek/deepseek-chat")
- `--validation-model`: LLM model for rule validation (default: "deepseek/deepseek-chat")
- `--log-rules-csv`: Enable CSV logging of successfully generated rules to stats/generated_rules_log.csv
- `--max-workers`: Maximum number of parallel workers for processing patches (default: 2)
- `--log-level`: Logging level (default: "INFO")

#### Rule Filter Script (rule_filter.py)
- `--input-dir`: Directory containing generated rules (default: "generated_rules")
- `--output-dir`: Directory for filtered rules (default: "filtered_rules")
- `--embedding-model`: Sentence-transformers model for embeddings (default: "all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

## Output

The final filtered rules will be available in the `filtered_rules` directory, organized by programming language. These rules can be used with either Semgrep or Opengrep projects:

```
filtered_rules/
├── python/
│   └── repo_rules.yml
├── javascript/
│   └── repo_rules.yml
└── java/
    └── repo_rules.yml
```

### Using the Generated Rules

1. With Semgrep:
```bash
semgrep --config filtered_rules/python/repo_rules.yml path/to/your/code
```

2. With Opengrep:
```bash
opengrep scan --rules filtered_rules/python/repo_rules.yml path/to/your/code
```
