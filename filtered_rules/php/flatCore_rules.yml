  message: 'Detected a potential security vulnerability where file deletion is performed
    based on unsanitized GET parameters. This can lead to path traversal attacks,
    allowing an attacker to delete arbitrary files on the server. The fix involves
    using POST requests with CSRF protection and proper file path handling using basename().
