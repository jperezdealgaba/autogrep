  message: "Detected potential command injection vulnerability due to unescaped user\
    \ input in shell command construction. \nThe variable `$searchstring` is directly\
    \ concatenated into a shell command without proper escaping, which could allow\
    \ an attacker to inject arbitrary commands. \nTo fix this, always use `escapeshellarg()`\
    \ to sanitize user input before including it in shell commands.\n"
