  message: 'The code uses `explode` to split a filename and appends ''_copy'' to the
    base name, which can lead to incorrect file handling and potential security issues.
    This approach is unsafe because it assumes the filename contains a single dot,
    which may not be true. Instead, directly prepend ''copyof_'' to the entire filename
    to avoid ambiguity and ensure consistent behavior.
