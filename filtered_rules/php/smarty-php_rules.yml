  message: 'Detected unsafe directory path handling in Smarty template engine. The
    vulnerability occurs when the directory path is constructed before validating
    the real path, which could allow directory traversal attacks. This can be exploited
    to access files outside the intended directory. The fix ensures that the real
    path is validated before constructing the directory path. To fix this, always
    validate the real path before using it in directory operations.

  message: 'The code is vulnerable to potential XSS attacks due to the direct inclusion
    of `$_template->source->filepath` in the output without proper sanitization. This
    could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. To fix this, use
    `str_replace` to sanitize the filepath by replacing ''*/'' with ''* /'' to prevent
    closing the comment block prematurely.
