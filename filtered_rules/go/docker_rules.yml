  message: 'Sensitive data fields such as ''password'', ''secret'', ''jointoken'',
    ''unlockkey'', and ''signingcakey'' are being scrubbed in a hardcoded manner.
    This approach is risky because it may miss new sensitive fields added in the future.
    Instead, use a predefined list of sensitive fields (like ''scrub'') to ensure
    consistent handling of sensitive data across all endpoints. This prevents potential
    data leaks due to oversight.
