  message: 'Detected a direct string concatenation with user input, which can lead
    to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The code directly returns a string
    that includes user-controlled input (`alias`) without proper sanitization. This
    can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the output. To fix this,
    use a safe HTML construction method like `hb.NewDiv()` to properly escape user
    input.
