  message: 'Using `TrimRight("\n\r")` to remove newline characters can be unsafe as
    it may not handle all variations of line endings correctly. This can lead to unexpected
    behavior or security issues. Replace it with separate `Replace("\n", "")` and
    `Replace("\r", "")` calls to ensure all newline characters are properly removed.
