  message: 'Detected a potential off-by-one error in a loop condition. The loop uses
    a size_t variable and decrements it, but the condition `i` could lead to an infinite
    loop when `i` becomes negative. This can cause undefined behavior or crashes.
    Fix by changing the condition to `i >= 0` and use `ssize_t` for the loop variable.
