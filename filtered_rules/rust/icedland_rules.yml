  message: 'Detected unsafe casting of `data_ptr` to `usize` for `displ_index`. This
    can lead to integer overflow or truncation issues. The fix involves casting to
    `u8` instead of `usize` to ensure proper bounds and prevent potential security
    vulnerabilities. Always use the appropriate type for index calculations to avoid
    overflow and ensure memory safety.
