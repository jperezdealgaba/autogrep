  message: 'The pattern matches a vulnerable regular expression in Nokogiri''s XML
    declaration detection that is susceptible to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial
    of Service). The original pattern allows for excessive backtracking when processing
    strings with many spaces, which can lead to significant performance degradation
    or denial of service. The fix removes the `+` quantifier to prevent backtracking.
    To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the regular expression does not allow for
    excessive backtracking.

  message: 'The DEFAULT_XML constant is set to RECOVER without the NONET flag, which
    can allow network access during XML parsing. This is dangerous because it can
    lead to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, where an attacker can exploit the XML
    parser to access local or remote resources. To fix this, ensure that the NONET
    flag is included to disable network access during parsing.
