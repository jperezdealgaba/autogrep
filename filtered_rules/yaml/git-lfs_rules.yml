  message: 'Using ''windows-latest'' in GitHub Actions workflows can lead to unexpected
    behavior due to automatic updates to the latest Windows version. This can cause
    compatibility issues or break CI/CD pipelines. It is recommended to pin the Windows
    version to a specific release (e.g., ''windows-2019'') to ensure consistent and
    predictable behavior.
