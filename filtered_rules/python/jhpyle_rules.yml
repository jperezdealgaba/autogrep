  message: 'Detected a potential path traversal vulnerability. The code only checks
    for ''../'' in the filename but does not prevent absolute paths, which could allow
    unauthorized access to files. Add a check for absolute paths using `filename.startswith(''/'')`
    to fully mitigate this risk.
