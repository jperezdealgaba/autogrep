  message: 'This rule detects insufficient length checks in SONMP protocol handling.
    The original check only verifies if the length is greater than SONMP_SIZE, but
    it does not account for additional required fields like Ethernet addresses and
    a 16-bit integer. This could lead to buffer underflows or incorrect packet processing.
    The fix adds the necessary length for these additional fields. Always ensure that
    length checks account for all required fields in network protocols.
