  message: 'Detected a potential NULL pointer dereference vulnerability. Checking
    if a buffer is NULL before using it in strcmp() can lead to undefined behavior
    if the buffer is NULL. Instead, check if the buffer is empty by using !*buf or
    *buf == 0.

    This vulnerability is dangerous because it can cause crashes or undefined behavior
    when processing NULL buffers. To fix it, replace the NULL check with a check for
    an empty buffer.
