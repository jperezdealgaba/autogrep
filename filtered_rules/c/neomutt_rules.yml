  message: 'The vulnerability involves an incorrect offset in the `mutt_error` function,
    which could lead to incorrect error message handling or potential information
    disclosure. The offset `+3` should be `+2` to correctly reference the intended
    string. This issue could be dangerous as it might expose sensitive information
    or cause incorrect error messages to be displayed. To fix this, ensure the correct
    offset is used when referencing the string.

  message: 'The function `mutt_b64_decode` is being called without specifying the
    output buffer size, which can lead to buffer overflows. This is dangerous because
    it can result in memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to execute
    arbitrary code or crash the application. Always pass the size of the output buffer
    as the third argument to `mutt_b64_decode` to prevent buffer overflows.
