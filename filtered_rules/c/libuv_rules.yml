  message: 'Detected a potential buffer underwrite vulnerability. The original code
    conditionally writes a null terminator without checking if the destination pointer
    is within bounds, which could lead to memory corruption. The fix ensures that
    the destination pointer is within bounds before performing the write.

    This is dangerous because it could allow an attacker to corrupt memory or cause
    a crash. Always validate buffer boundaries before writing to memory.
