  message: 'The vulnerability occurs when a certificate''s revocation date check is
    bypassed by directly returning 1 without proper validation. This could allow revoked
    certificates to be treated as valid, leading to potential security risks such
    as man-in-the-middle attacks. The fix ensures that the revocation date is properly
    checked before returning a result. Always validate the revocation date before
    returning a value.
