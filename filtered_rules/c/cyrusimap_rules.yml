  message: 'Detected a loop that unnecessarily checks if a seed value is zero. This
    can lead to unnecessary CPU cycles and potential denial of service if the random
    number generator frequently returns zero. The seed value being zero is not inherently
    dangerous and should be accepted as a valid value.

    To fix this, remove the loop and directly assign the result of rand() to the seed
    variable.
