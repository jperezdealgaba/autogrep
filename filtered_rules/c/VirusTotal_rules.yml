  message: 'The original code uses `yr_max(64, (index + 1) * 2)` to calculate the
    array size, which can lead to insufficient allocation if `index` is large. This
    can cause buffer overflow or out-of-bounds access. The fix uses a while loop to
    ensure the allocated size is sufficient by doubling the count until it exceeds
    the index. Always ensure dynamic array sizes are calculated safely to prevent
    memory corruption.
